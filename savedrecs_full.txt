AB Background: Adolescents are at high risk of sexual assault compared to any other age group. The pattern of post-traumatic stress symptoms plus life-impairing disturbances in self-organization (emotion dysregulation, negative self-concept and interpersonal problems) is termed Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). Research about CPTSD after sexual assault in adolescents is limited owing to the challenges associated with assessing this group. This study aims to determine the frequency and structure of CPTSD, and the relationship of emotion dysregulation with impairment and additional trauma exposure among adolescents who have been sexually assaulted. Method: Prospective cohort study of adolescents attending the Sexual Assault Referral Centres serving London over a 2-year period. We conducted cross-sectional analyses (n = 99) on data collected 4-5 months after sexual assault, and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) and Latent Class Analyses (LCA) to determine the CPTSD profile. CTPSD was defined according to the ICD-11, selecting symptom indicators from the following measures: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13), Short version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (S-MFQ), The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). We analysed the association of CPTSD symptom domains with impairment (measured with the SDQ, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale; C-GAS) and with additional trauma exposure. Results: The frequency of ICD-11 PTSD was 59%, and of ICD-11 CPTSD was 40%. CPTSD symptoms showed a strong fit for a correlated 4-factor model, and LCA distinguished a class of participants with high levels of CPTSD symptoms. Emotion dysregulation was associated with impairment in functioning and exposure to trauma beyond other self-organization disturbances and core PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Disturbances in self-organization are frequent in sexually assaulted adolescents, and emotion dysregulation is associated with impairment and further exposure to trauma. Emotion dysregulation should be considered in preventive and treatment strategies for these vulnerable youth.

AB Objective: We compared clinic-referred youth with ADHD + sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT; n = 34), ADHD Only (n = 108), and SCT Only (n = 22) on demographics, co-occurring symptomatology, comorbid diagnoses, and social functioning. Method: In total, 164 youth (age = 6-17 years, M = 9.97) and their parent(s) presented to an outpatient clinic for a psychoeducational assessment. Between-group analyses and regressions were used to examine study variables. Results: SCT groups were older and exhibited more parent-reported internalizing problems, externalizing problems, sleep problems, and social withdrawal on the Child Behavior Checklist. No significant differences emerged between groups on the Teacher Report Form. Regression analyses involving multiple covariates revealed that SCT symptoms were uniquely related to social withdrawal but not general social problems. Conclusion: Based on parent report, SCT symptoms have a unique relationship with internalizing problems, sleep problems, and social withdrawal. Future research should explore correlates of SCT in youth using multiple informants.

AB The present study investigated the role of parenting stress in early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior and, particularly, the moderating effect of maternal affection on these associations. The data of 992 early adolescents ((X) over bar (age) = 12.71; 454 girls) and their mothers during the transition from primary school to lower secondary school were analyzed. The results showed that when maternal affection was low, parenting stress was not related to the changes in early adolescents' externalizing or internalizing behavior. In contrast, when maternal affection was high, low parenting stress related to a decrease and high parenting stress to an increase in such behavior. The results were statistically significant and stronger for internalizing behavior; for externalizing behavior, they were marginally significant but showed the same pattern. Overall, the results support the idea that maternal affection provides a context which intensifies (rather than ameliorates) the influence of parenting stress on early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior.

AB Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI's psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI's structure and psychometric properties. Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences. Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

AB Research on emotion regulation is now extensive and shows the benefits of the adaptive management of emotions for social functioning and psychological well-being. Our purpose was to test the psychometric properties of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents with a sample of nonclinical Spanish adolescents. A total of 462 secondary education students (223 girls, mean age = 13.89 years, SD = 1.38) participated. The instrument proved to be two-factor and gender-invariant. Results revealed the temporal stability of both emotion regulation strategies, while the predictive validity study revealed that depressive symptoms were negatively related to cognitive reappraisal, and positively related to expressive suppression. Our findings support the use of the ERQ-SpA in Spanish adolescents.

AB Background: The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) is an instrument that assesses nine cognitive strategies to cope with negative situations. The aim of this study was to validate the CERQ for a sample of Spanish adolescents, to analyse reliability and validity, and to examine the factor structure by confirmatory factor analysis. Method: The Spanish version of CERQ (CERQ-S) and other scales (gratitude, emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and stress) were completed by 835 adolescents aged 14-18 (455 girls) from the South of Spain. Results: The results showed that the CERQ-S in adolescents (CERQ-SA) has appropriate psychometric properties with indexes of reliability alpha = .89 and omega = .96. and the original nine-factor structure was confirmed. There was also significant correlation between the CERQ-SA and the other scales, showing evidence of convergent validity. Conclusions: The results suggest that the CERQ-SA could be useful for appraising cognitive coping in adolescents. This will help to expand the study and understanding of these strategies, their influence and their consequences for adolescents psychological functioning and health.

AB The present study aimed to identify the evidence of validity of the internal structure and in relation to other variables of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-18) in peruvian adolescents. The sample consisted of 255 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (M=15.494, DE=1.192) from a public school of the district of Ventanilla (Peru). The instruments used were the CERQ-18 and the State / Trait Depression Inventory. Four structural hypotheses were proposed, which were evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis, including bifactor analysis. The results indicate that the evolutionary model represented by automatic (self-blame, rumination, catastrophization) and deliberate strategies (acceptance, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, positive refocusing and putting into perspective), present satisfactory indicators, favoring their interpretation, and showing significant relationships with positive and negative affect. It is concluded that the internal structure of CERQ-18 in adolescents is supported by the evolutionary model.

AB An inverted U-shaped pattern in heart rate (HR) and a U-shaped pattern in heart rate variability (HRV) are easily recognizable when individuals experience any acute stressor. How cardiac complexity (scaling and entropy) changes under acute stress is not well known. Psychologically, emotion regulation (ER) style is likely to influence the individual's specific behavioral response when affronting stress. This study tested whether adolescents with distinct ER styles would show different patterns of linear and nonlinear cardiac changes under stressful conditions. We predicted less autonomic flexibility for adolescents with a highly negative emotional regulation (HNER) style (n = 10) than for those adolescents with a highly positive emotional regulation (HPER) style (n=10). Further, associations between linear and nonlinear measures during each condition were examined for each group. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that HR and HRV changed according to the predicted pattern. Higuchi's fractal dimension and Sample Entropy followed a U-shaped pattern, whereas the short-term scaling exponent followed the reverse pattern. Cardiac changes across conditions were larger in the HPER group. Significant associations between linear and nonlinear measures were found in the HPER group but not in the HNER group. Results are cautiously discussed within a multiscale framework of fluctuations of the different cardiac features.

AB There is little neurological evidence linking sensation seeking and emotion regulation in adolescence, which is characterised as an emotionally fluctuant period. The present study examined the relationship between sensation seeking and emotion regulation in adolescents. Electroencephalograms were recorded from 22 high sensation-seeking adolescents (HSSs, M-age = 12.36) and 24 low sensation-seeking adolescents (LSSs, M-age = 12.84) during the reactivity and regulation-image task. Group differences in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) associated with the regulation of negative and neutral stimuli were analysed. The results showed that (a) the P2 of HSSs were larger than LSSs during emotion regulation; (b) in down-regulation conditions, the LPP in all time windows were smaller than no-regulation in LSSs. However, there was no significant difference in HSSs; (c) the LPP 300-600 and LPP 1000-1500 of down-regulation were smaller in LSSs than HSSs; (d) for LPP 600-1000, HSSs induced larger LPP than LSSs in the negative down-regulation and negative no-regulation conditions. The results provide neurological evidence that higher sensation seeking is related to the high reactivity to emotional stimuli and poor cognitive control during the regulation of emotions.

AB This study applied emotion regulation theory to examine parental communication that predicts possible markers of adolescent resilience in families of harmful versus non-harmful parental alcohol use. Parent-adolescent dyads (30 with and 30 without harmful parental alcohol use) participated in video-taped interactions rated for parents' emotion coaching and emotion dismissing communication and adolescents' emotion regulation and behavioral impulsivity. Emotion coaching was positively associated with adolescent emotion regulation and behavioral impulsivity. Emotion dismissing was only positively associated with adolescent behavioral impulsivity. Adolescents in families of harmful alcohol use demonstrated more impulsivity but also showed more emotion regulation in the presence of emotion dismissing communication. Findings suggest that dimensions of parental communication are uniquely associated with potential markers of adolescent resilience. For families of harmful parental alcohol use, results point to a need for greater consistency in parental communication behavior and efficacy in modeling desired expressions of emotions to foster adolescent resilience.

AB This study examined associations between tic severity, emotion regulation, social functioning, and social impairment in youth with Tourette Syndrome (TS). Emotion regulation was examined as a mediator between tic severity and social outcomes. Seventy-seven caregivers of youth with TS (M age = 13.1 years; SD = 2.29) were administered proxy-report measures of tic severity, emotion regulation, social functioning, and social impairment. Total and motor tic severity were negatively associated with emotion regulation and social functioning, and positively associated with social impairment (r's = 0.23 to 0.43). Vocal tic severity was not related to emotion regulation or social functioning, but was positively associated with social impairment (r = 0.36). Emotion regulation mediated the relations between total tic severity and both social outcomes, and motor tic severity and both social outcomes. Interventions that target emotion regulation would likely be a beneficial adjunctive therapy for youth with TS, and may result in improved social outcomes.

AB A growing number of studies support the internal and external validity of youth self-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms. However, no study has examined SCT in adolescents without ADHD, examined whether adolescent self-reported SCT is distinct from adolescent self-reported ADHD inattention (ADHD-IN), or evaluated whether links between SCT and internalizing problems differ for adolescents with or without ADHD. The present study is the first to (1) determine the convergent and discriminant validity of self-reported SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms in both adolescents with and without ADHD, (2) test the invariance of SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms across ADHD and comparison groups, (3) examine SCT as uniquely related to a range of internalizing-relevant domains, and (4) evaluate if the association between SCT with internalizing correlates differs for adolescents with or without ADHD. Participants were adolescents (M-age = 13 years) with (n = 162) and without (n = 140) ADHD. Adolescents and parents completed measures of internalizing symptoms and emotion dysregulation; adolescents completed measures of rumination and suicidal ideation. Analyses indicated that 13 of the 15 SCT items demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity from ADHD-IN, and SCT and ADHD-IN demonstrated invariance across the ADHD and comparison groups and across sex. SCT, but not ADHD-IN, was uniquely associated with greater adolescent-reported internalizing symptoms and suicidal ideation. Both SCT and ADHD-IN were uniquely associated with adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. Only ADHD-IN was uniquely associated with parent-reported emotion dysregulation. Findings support the differentiation of adolescent-reported SCT and ADHD-IN and demonstrate associations between SCT and increased internalizing problems in adolescents with and without ADHD.

AB IMPORTANCE Social media use may be a risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated this association, and none have quantified the proportion of mental health problems among adolescents attributable to social media use.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether time spent using social media per day is prospectively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of 6595 participants from waves 1 (September 12, 2013, to December 14, 2014), 2 (October 23, 2014, to October 30, 2015), and 3 (October 18, 2015, to October 23, 2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative cohort study of US adolescents, assessed US adolescents via household interviews using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Data analysis was performed from January 14, 2019, to May 22, 2019.
   EXPOSURES Self-reported time spent on social media during a typical day (none, <= 30 minutes, >30 minutes to <= 3 hours, >3 hours to <= 6 hours, and >6 hours) during wave 2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE Self-reported past-year internalizing problems alone, externalizing problems alone, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems during wave 3 using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener.
   RESULTS A total of 6595 adolescents (aged 12-15 years during wave 1; 3400 [51.3%] male) were studied. In unadjusted analyses, spending more than 30 minutes of time on social media, compared with no use, was associated with increased risk of internalizing problems alone (<= 30 minutes: relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94-1.78; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.36-2.64; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.74-3.49; >6 hours: RRR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.88-4.26) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (<= 30 minutes: RRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.83-3.00; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.43-4.09; >6 hours: RRR, 4.29; 95% CI, 3.22-5.73); associations with externalizing problems were inconsistent. In adjusted analyses, use of social media for more than 3 hours per day compared with no use remained significantly associated with internalizing problems alone (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11-2.31; >6 hours: RRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.77) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.51-2.66; >6 hours: RRR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.73-3.43) but not externalizing problems alone.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per day using social media may be at heightened risk for mental health problems, particularly internalizing problems. Future research should determine whether setting limits on daily social media use, increasing media literacy, and redesigning social media platforms are effective means of reducing the burden of mental health problems in this population.

AB This study examined the degree to which internalizing symptoms predict adolescent friendship instability. A total of 397 adolescents identified 499 same-sex reciprocated friendships that originated in the seventh grade (M = 13.18 years). Discrete-time survival analyses were conducted with Grade 7 peer, teacher, and self-reports of internalizing symptoms as predictors of friendship dissolution across Grades 8-12. Differences between friends in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and (for boys only) submissiveness predicted subsequent friendship dissolution. Individual levels of these variables did not predict friendship dissolution, even at extreme or clinical levels. The findings suggest that friendship instability arising from internalizing problems stems from dissimilarity between friends rather than the presence of psychopathological symptoms on the part of one friend.

AB Adolescents learn about emotions through interacting with parents and friends, though there is limited longitudinal research on this topic. This study examined longitudinal patterns in parent and friend emotion socialization and adolescent emotion regulation. Eighty-seven adolescents reported on parent and friend emotion socialization. Parents reported on adolescent emotion regulation. Parents' responses were stable over time and across gender. Friends of girls reciprocated negative emotions more and were less punitive over time, whereas friends of boys increased in comforting and decreased in neglect of negative emotions. Parents and friends evidenced unique effects on adolescent emotion regulation, and the effect of friend socialization responses differed for girls and boys. Future research should examine combinatory influences of multiple socializers on adolescent adjustment.

AB Adaptive mother-adolescent conflict interactions are characterized by the ability to move from negative to positive emotions. The current micro-observational study investigated how mothers and adolescents make transitions between positive, neutral and negative emotions and whether these transitions depend on maternal internalizing problems. We used three annual waves of conflict interaction observations among 102 mother-adolescent dyads. Mothers were more likely than adolescents to initiate positivity after negativity whereas adolescents were more likely than mothers to reciprocate negativity. Mothers high and low in internalizing problems were equally likely to drive transitions toward positivity. Our study indicates that an active role of mothers in regulating negativity toward positivity is desirable because adolescents are likely to maintain dysfunctional interaction patterns of rigid negativity.

AB ObjectivesTwo processes that have been largely studied in relation to psychological wellbeing during adolescence are mindfulness and psychological flexibility. Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) and Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y) are specifically developed for children and adolescents and their items are built to assess specific processes. This study aims to identify cut-offs detecting adolescents with internalizing disorders, and describing specific behavioral repertoires within participants with high Psychological Inflexibility and poor Mindfulness Skills.MethodParticipants (N=1336), aged between 11 and 18, were recruited. Participants completed the Italian versions of CAMM, AFQ-Y, and Youth Self-Report (YSR). To determine the cut-offs for CAMM and AFQ-Y discriminating participants with internalizing disorders two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. Furthermore, to identify homogeneous groups with specific behavioral repertoires two Classification Tree Analyses (CTA) were performed.ResultsThe cut-offs identified are 24 for the CAMM, and 11 for the AFQ-Y. The CTA showed that low Mindfulness Skills and Psychological Inflexibility share a specific feature: namely, depressive symptoms. However, social withdrawal seems to be associated only with low Mindfulness Skills, while somatic symptoms seems to be associated only with Psychological Inflexibility.ConclusionsThe potential uses of the CAMM and AFQ-Y in research and clinical practice are drawn. CAMM and AFQ-Y are short and simple measures that make them accessible in a school-based primary prevention setting.

AB This study aimed to explore the relationships among early adolescents' perceived parental psychological control/autonomy support, self-trouble, and internalizing problems as well as the potential gender differences in these relationships. Multiple-group path analysis was performed on the data collected from 1,089 adolescents in Beijing junior high schools. Results revealed that parental psychological control (autonomy support) was associated with adolescents' more (fewer) internalizing problems, and self-trouble acted as a mediator in these two relationships. Moreover, only the indirect relationship between parental autonomy support and internalizing problems via self-trouble was moderated by gender, with girls showing a little stronger indirect effect than boys, and specifically, it was the relationship between autonomy support and self-trouble that existed gender differences, with girls showing higher coefficient than boys. The relationship between parental psychological control/autonomy support and early adolescents' internalizing problems was discussed with regard to self-trouble and gender differences.

AB The current cross-sectional study examined whether internalizing (i.e. anxiety and depressive) symptoms and/or emotion dysregulation moderated the association between witnessed community violence and aggressive behavior. Participants were 180 predominantly African American adolescents (62% girls; M age = 15.87 years, SD = 1.19 years) from a high school located in an urban community in the United States. Approximately 95% of adolescents reported having witnessed at least one violent act during their lifetimes, with many endorsing repeated exposure to severe acts of community violence. Results indicated that emotion dysregulation exacerbated the association between witnessed community violence and aggression. A quadratic effect of anxiety symptoms also moderated this association, such that witnessed community violence was linked to aggression at low and high, but not moderate, levels of anxiety symptoms. In contrast, a quadratic effect of depressive symptoms was uniquely related to aggression, regardless of witnessed community violence. Directions for future research and implications for practice are reviewed.

AB Background Among adolescent girls, anorexia nervosa (AN) and major depression (MD) are common and often comorbid mental health problems. Both disorders are characterised by difficulties in recognising and verbalising (alexithymia) as well as regulating one's emotions, but research in adolescent patients is scarce and little is known about the relation between alexithymia and difficulties in emotion regulation. The aims of this study were to investigate alexithymia and emotion regulation skills in adolescents with AN, adolescents with MD, and healthy adolescents, and to determine whether alexithymia functions as a predictor for emotion regulation skills. Methods Emotion regulation strategies, alexithymia, and depressive symptoms were assessed by questionnaire measures in 12-18 year old girls with AN (n = 26), girls with MD (n = 25), and healthy girls (n = 35). Groups were compared with respect to the these variables and multiple regression analyses were calculated separately for adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in order to examine if alexithymia predicted emotion regulation over and above age and depressive symptoms. Results Girls with AN or MD both reported using adaptive emotion regulation strategies less frequently and maladaptive emotion regulation skills more frequently as well as higher levels of alexithymia compared to healthy girls. Alexithymia positively predicted maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, while depressive symptoms negatively predicted adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Conclusions The results suggest that different mechanisms may underlie the lack of adaptive and the surplus of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in adolescent psychiatric patients.

AB Background and Objectives Previous research has yielded equivocal findings regarding whether internalizing symptoms are risk factors for adolescent hazardous alcohol use (AU), specifically in the presence of externalizing symptoms. This may be due to the type of internalizing symptoms examined (ie, distress vs fear), and the use of primarily normative rather than clinical samples. Thus, we tested internalizing and externalizing symptom interactions as they relate to adolescent hazardous AU in a high-risk, clinical sample of adolescents. Methods Adolescents (N = 101; 66% female; M-age = 15) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit and assessed for current symptoms. Hypotheses were tested by running a series of moderation models regressing hazardous AU on a set of internalizing symptoms (ie, depression, generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], social anxiety, separation anxiety, school avoidance, and panic), each interacting with externalizing symptoms. Results We observed significant interactions between several internalizing symptoms (depression, GAD, and panic symptoms) and externalizing symptoms predicting hazardous AU. These internalizing symptoms were unrelated to AU at low and average levels of externalizing symptoms, but were positively related to AU at high levels of externalizing symptoms. Discussion and Conclusions In this clinical sample, distress-related internalizing symptomatology was associated with risk for, and not protection against, hazardous AU, but only when accompanied by high externalizing symptoms. Scientific Significance Findings suggest that whether or not internalizing symptoms operate synergistically with externalizing symptoms to predict hazardous AU depends on the subdomain of internalizing symptoms (distress vs fear) and perhaps the type of sample (ie, clinical vs community).

AB Background: Binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity in adolescents is associated with variations in social cognition and emotion regulation. The current study aimed to evaluate the Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in adolescents with obesity with and without BED and to examine how they related to emotional and psychopathologic evaluations. Methods: One hundred twenty-eight adolescents comprising 32 non-BED adolescents with obesity, 32 adolescents with BED and obesity, and 64 healthy controls (HC) completed a battery of tests to analyze their social cognition and clinical psychopathologic profile. Results: Patients with BED and non-BED patients with obesity showed poorer performance in emotional regulation and social cognition tasks compared with normal-weight adolescents without BED. Various correlations were evident between depression, emotional regulation problems, and eating attitudes and patterns. Conclusions: Patients with BED and non-BED adolescents with obesity showed a decline in ToM tasks, independent of their clinical psychopathological profile. Consistent with other studies, this is the first study to assess both social cognition and emotion regulation skills in adolescents with BED and obesity.

AB Mental health problems often emerge in adolescence and are associated with reduced gray matter thickness or volume in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic system and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) of white matter linking these regions. However, few studies have investigated whether internalizing and externalizing behavior are associated with brain structure in children and adolescents without mental health disorders, which is important for understanding the progression of symptoms. 67 T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging datasets were obtained from 48 typically developing participants aged 6-16 years (37M/30F; 19 participants had two visits). Volume was calculated in the prefrontal and limbic structures, and diffusion parameters were assessed in limbic white matter. Linear mixed effects models were used to compute associations between brain structure and internalizing and externalizing behavior, assessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) Parent Rating Scale. Internalizing behavior was positively associated with MD of the bilateral cingulum. Gender interactions were found in the cingulum, with stronger positive relationships between MD and internalizing behavior in females. Externalizing behavior was negatively associated with FA of the left cingulum, and the left uncinate fasciculus showed an age-behavior interaction. No relationships between behavior and brain volumes survived multiple comparison correction. These results show altered limbic white matter FA and MD related to sub-clinical internalizing and externalizing behavior and further our understanding of neurological markers that may underlie risk for future mental health disorders.

AB Parental threatening behaviors have emerged as a subset of negative parental behaviors strongly related to internalizing symptoms among youth, yet the underlying mechanisms in this association have remained unexplored. The current investigation examined the role of difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior while emotionally distressed in the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient psychiatric youth. Participants (N = 50; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [0.51] years; age range, 12-17 years) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, exposure to maternal threatening behaviors, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, as well as trauma-related functional impairment. Results revealed that inability to engage in goal-directed behavior while distressed significantly explained associations between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and each of the three symptom classes, but not the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and trauma-related functional impairment. These novel findings underscore the need for interventions that target the capacity for goal-directed behavior in the context of emotional distress, especially among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threatening behaviors.

AB This article aims to verify the effect of systemic family therapy on the symptomatology of internalizing and externalizing factors in adolescents. The sample was of 109 adolescents, of which 56% were men and 54% women, with a mean age of 15.1 years. Systemic family therapy, under the conditions in which it has been applied, has had a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect. The success rate attributable to treatment was 46% in the Internalizing factor, 43% in Outsourcer, 60% in Somatic Complaints, 43% in Anxiety/Depression and 55% in Aggressive Behavior. These results contribute to the need to align this type of health intervention with the school environment in adolescents.

AB Guided by theory stressing person-environment interactions, we tested whether parenting correlates of peer victimization would be stronger for adolescents with internalizing difficulties than those without. Participants (N = 362, 56.4% girls, M age = 16.11, 56% Latino) in the 9th to 11th grades responded to questionnaires about their parents' behavior and nominated their peers on items tapping internalizing behaviors and victimization experiences. Both positive (i.e., warmth) and negative dimensions of parenting (overprotectiveness, threat of rejection, coercion) were more strongly associated with victimization at high levels of internalizing and minimized at low levels of internalizing. Girls and older adolescents with internalizing were particularly sensitive to overprotectiveness. Adolescents became increasingly sensitive to coercion as they got older. Discussion addresses individuals' differential susceptibility which may elucidate why some adolescents might be more affected than others by what parents do.

AB Non-human primate models have been useful in clarifying estradiol's role in cognitive processing. These animal studies indicate estradiol impacts cognitive processes supported by regions within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although human functional neuroimaging studies have begun to find similar relationships between estradiol in women for some forms of 'cold' cognitive control, to date no studies have examined the relationship between estradiol and DLPFC function in the context of active attempts to regulate one's emotions. Here, we asked whether peripheral 17-beta estradiol levels in adolescent girls in different pubertal developmental stages (age = 14.9 years +/- 1.74) were related to engagement of DLPFC regions during the use of a cognitive strategy for regulating emotion known as reappraisal using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Findings indicated that higher estradiol levels predicted greater DLPFC activity during the down-regulation of negative emotion using reappraisal. This is the first report of an association between estradiol level and DLPFC activity during cognitive reappraisal of negative emotion. The study suggests a possibility that estradiol might positively contribute to regulatory function of a cortical system important for emotional experiences.

AB BACKGROUND: Conduct disorder (CD), which is characterized by severe aggressive and antisocial behavior, is linked to emotion processing and regulation deficits. However, the neural correlates of emotion regulation are yet to be investigated in adolescents with CD. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether CD is associated with deficits in emotional reactivity, emotion regulation, or both.
   METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study effortful emotion regulation by cognitive reappraisal in 59 female adolescents 15 to 18 years of age (30 with a CD diagnosis and 29 typically developing (TD) control adolescents).
   RESULTS: Behaviorally, in-scanner self-report ratings confirmed successful emotion regulation within each group individually but significant group differences in emotional reactivity and reappraisal success when comparing the groups (CD < TD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results revealed significantly lower activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus in CD compared with TD adolescents during emotion regulation, but no group differences for emotional reactivity. Furthermore, connectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral putamen, right prefrontal cortex, and amygdala was reduced in CD compared with TD adolescents during reappraisal. Callous-unemotional traits were unrelated to neural activation, but these traits correlated negatively with behavioral reports of emotional reactivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate reduced prefrontal brain activity and functional connectivity during effortful emotion regulation in female adolescents with CD. This sheds light on the neural basis of the behavioral deficits that have been reported previously. Future studies should investigate whether cognitive interventions are effective in enhancing emotion-regulation abilities and/or normalizing prefrontal and temporoparietal activity in female adolescents with CD.

AB The study aimed to assess the relationship between bullying victimization and adverse health or psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents from five Southeast Asian countries. The sample consisted of 33,184 school-going children, mean age 14.6 years (SD = 1.7), from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the cross-sectional "Global School-based Student Health Survey" (GSHS) in 2015. Results indicate 18.6% of the students reported infrequent (1-2 days/month) and 12.0% frequent (3-30 days/month) past-month bullying victimization. Among different types of bullying victimization, the most prevalent was psychological (13.5%), followed by other (5.6%), physical (3.6%) and social (1.3%). In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, bullying victimization is associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug use, physically attacked, in physical fight, injury, truancy and poor hand hygiene behaviour, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, no close friends, sedentary behaviour, underweight and overweight or obesity. This study extends previous findings from mainly high-income countries on the relationship between bullying victimization and a large number of adverse outcomes in adolescents in Southeast Asia.

AB Objectives This study explores the relations between the functional subtypes of relational aggression (proactive and reactive) and difficulties with emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression). Further, it examines the moderating role of parental attachment including parental availability and dependency in these associations. Based on previous research, it was expected that difficulties in emotion regulation strategies would be associated with reactive but not with proactive relational aggression, and these links would be moderated by self-reported attachment quality to both parents. Methods Participants of the study were 518 Greek junior high school students (50% girls), aged between 12 t omicron 16 (M = 13.66, SD = 1.13) who completed a self-report questionnaire. Results The results showed that expressive suppression holds a positive association only with reactive but not with proactive relational aggression, while low maternal attachment security was linked to both proactive and reactive relational aggression. Moderation analyses also revealed that at low levels of perceived dependency on father the expressive suppression was negatively associated with student's engagement in proactive relational aggression. The findings also evidenced that gender differentiates adolescents' self-reported engagement in proactive RA and perceived dependency on father for males as well as cognitive reappraisal for females. Conclusions The importance of exploring interpersonal factors along with individual traits in the interpretation of relational aggression is discussed.

AB Objective: We evaluated whether initiating the Family Check-Up (FCU) during early childhood prevented a severe form of psychopathology in adolescence-co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems-and whether effects operated indirectly through early childhood maternal depression and parents' positive behavior support. Method: Participants were drawn from a randomized controlled trial of the FCU (50.2% FCU; 49.5% girls; 46.6% Caucasian, and 27.6% Black; 13.4% Hispanic/Latino). At Ages 2 and 3, mothers self-reported depression, and primary caregivers' (PCs') positive behavior support was coded by trained observers. PCs, alternate caregivers (ACs), and teachers reported on 14-year-olds' problem behaviors. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) identified problem behavior groups for each reporter. which were outcomes in multinomial logistic regressions (PC, n = 672; AC, n = 652; teacher, n = 667). Results: LPAs identified a low-problem, internalizing-only, externalizing-only, and co-occurringproblem group for each reporter. For PC- and AC-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, externalizingonly (p < .05), and internalizing-only (p < .05 for PC, p < 0.10 for AC) groups; these effects operated through maternal depression (p < .05). For teacher-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, internalizingonly, and externalizing-only (p < 0.05) groups; effects operated through positive behavior support (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Early delivery of the FCU indirectly prevented adolescents' co-occurring internalizing/externalizing problems in both home and school contexts by improving the quality of the early home environment.

AB Shame plays a central role in social and self-development, particularly throughout childhood and adolescence. Nonetheless, shame can also be harmful if it involves unbearable and persistent feelings of being inferior, inadequate, and worthless. Gender differences in endorsing either internalizing/externalizing symptoms may reflect different ways of coping with shame rather than differences in the experience of shame per se. Using a community adolescent sample (n = 368; 65.8% female), this study investigated the role of external shame and shame coping strategies in the endorsement of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, looking at the moderator role of gender. Although gender differences were found in the endorsement of shame coping strategies and psychological symptoms, results indicated that gender had no impact on the pathways linking external shame and shame coping strategies to psychological symptoms. By clarifying the routes linking external shame to psychological symptoms, current findings may contribute to better define appropriate interventions for adolescents.

AB Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic condition requiring intensive daily self-care to avoid both high and low blood glucose levels. Self-care and glycemic outcomes are particularly problematic in adolescence, a period known for its increased risk of emotional problems. However, the true scope of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescents with T1D is unknown. Earlier studies are limited by a small sample size, lack of diagnostic interview data, a focus on depression only, non-adolescent specific estimates, lack of information about parental emotional problems and/or a cross-sectional design. Diabetes LEAP is a two-year prospective observational cohort study examining (a) the prevalence and course of depression and anxiety in adolescents with T1D and their parents/caregivers, (b) the risk factors predicting the presence of these emotional problems, (c) their longitudinal relation with diabetes outcomes, and (d) the psychosocial care currently in place. Methods Adolescents (12-18 years) from 8 Dutch pediatric diabetes clinics are interviewed using the DISC-IV to establish the presence of mood and anxiety disorders in the previous 4 weeks, the previous 12 months, and lifetime. They also complete questionnaires, including CDI-2, GAD-7, and PAID-T. Parents/caregivers complete PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PAID-PR. Follow-up assessments take place after 1 and 2 years. Discussion This longitudinal study with diagnostic interviews in a large cohort of adolescents with T1D in the Netherlands will provide much needed information regarding the prevalence and course of depression and anxiety in this group, thereby opening avenues for proper recognition, prevention and timely treatment.

AB The current study examined unfolding relations among mothers' mindful parenting, parent-adolescent recurrent conflict, and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems. In a community sample of 117 families (31% black, Asian, American Indian, or Latino), parents and adolescents (52% female; average age = 12.13 years) were followed over 15 months. Parents answered questions about mindful parenting and recurrent conflict, and adolescents reported on their own externalizing and internalizing problems. Path analyses indicated that higher levels of mindful parenting were significantly related to lower levels of recurrent conflict 2-3 months later, controlling for previous levels of recurrent conflict. Moreover, lower levels of recurrent conflict were significantly related to lower levels of externalizing problems and internalizing problems 1 year later, controlling for previous levels of those problems. Subgroup analyses indicated that relations were comparable across subgroups defined by adolescent gender, race, parent marital status, and family financial strain. The effects of mindful parenting were robust even after accounting for other indicators of positive and supportive parenting, namely inductive reasoning and warmth in the parent-adolescent relationship. These findings highlight the potential of mindful parenting to improve family interactions and adolescent adjustment.

AB Objective Although clinical studies suggest that bulimia symptoms are common in youth, research on the prevalence of such symptoms and of their association with comorbid internalizing problems in the general population has been limited. This study aimed to evaluate the gender-specific prevalence of bulimia symptoms in Czech youth and explored the association between a clinical level of self-reported bulimia symptoms (CLBS) and internalizing problems by gender, controlling for age, socio-economic status and puberty status. Method The study was conducted on a representative national sample of Czech youth (N = 4430, 57.0% female) using self-report scales. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to examine the associations. Results The 3-month CLBS prevalence was higher in girls (11.4%) than in boys (3.8%) and in both genders a CLBS was associated with higher levels of comorbid internalizing problems. Discussion Timely recognition of bulimia symptoms and associated risk factors is important for early prevention and intervention strategies.

AB Problematic family functioning places young adolescents at risk for internalizing behaviors. However, not all adolescents who experience family risk develop internalizing behaviors during early adolescence. Informed by a cumulative risk perspective, the current study examined whether associations between cumulative family risk, as well as particular family risk domains, and youth internalizing behaviors are moderated by youth parasympathetic reactivity. Participants include 68 young adolescents in 6th grade. Youth were 56% female, 41% African American, and 54% European American. For young adolescents who experienced higher change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia during a challenge/stressor task, greater cumulative family risk, exposure to more family risk domains, and several particular risk factors (maternal psychological well-being, marital/family system risk), were associated with higher levels of internalizing behaviors. The findings from this study demonstrate that the extent to which both particular family risk factors and cumulative family risk place youth at increased risk for internalizing behaviors depends on youth's parasympathetic functioning.

AB Background: Both depression and anxiety (two of the most common internalizing psychopathologies among youths) are associated with difficulties in emotion regulation (ER). Little is known about whether anxiety as a comorbid condition has an effect on the habitual use of different ER strategies in youngsters with depression histories. We aimed 1) to compare ER in adolescents with histories of childhood onset major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety and 2) to examine whether certain ER response clusters (Cognitive, Social, and Behavioral/Physical) characterize comorbid children and adolescents.
   Methods: We analyzed data on 217 youth (11-18 years old) with depression history: 85 subjects with lifetime anxiety comorbidity (comorbid group) and 132 without lifetime anxiety (non-comorbid group). Psychiatric diagnosis was established by a comprehensive Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV-based diagnostic procedure. ER strategies were examined via the self-rated "Feelings and Me" Child version questionnaire (FAM-C).
   Results: The comorbid group used maladaptive ER strategies significantly more frequently than the non-comorbid youngsters. The Behavioral/Physical and Social ER skills, especially those reflecting social withdrawal and self-harm, were responsible for the higher maladaptive scores.
   Limitations: Because our study is a cross-sectional analysis, we have no information about the development or the onset of maladaptive ER strategies. Therefore, we were unable to examine whether maladaptive ER was a risk factor or a consequence of the internalizing psychopathology and comorbidity.
   Conclusions: Comorbid anxiety worsens the impaired use of ER strategies in depression-prone youths. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore the causal role of dysfunctional ER in the development of internalizing psychopathology.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine associations of disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) with body image problems, parents' eating disorder symptoms, and emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 200 adolescents (M age = 15.24 +/- 1.45 years) with T1D completed a self-report measure of DEBs and body ideal internalization, and their parents completed self-report measures of parents' eating problems and child's psychological symptoms. Seventy-three (36.5%) adolescents were DEPS-r-positive (scores >= 20), with higher rates among girls (chi(2) = 9.034, p = .003). Adolescents with T1D and DEBs reported lower SES, worse metabolic control, higher zBMI (p < .001), more eating disorder symptoms, more body image problems, and more emotional and behavioral problems than adolescents with T1D but no DEBs (all p < .05). Parents of adolescents with DEBs showed higher levels of bulimia (p = .028) than parents of adolescents without DEBs. In both genders, pressure to conform to societal norms about body image (p < .01) and externalization symptoms (p < .05) emerged as significant predictors of DEBs. Findings suggest that adolescents with T1D and DEBs showed an alarming psychological condition, with higher level of body image and more emotional and behavioral problems.

AB hildhood trauma has been identified as a strong risk factor for non-suicidal self- injury (NSSI; Gratz, 2006). Existing literature suggests that the degree of betrayal involved in a traumatic experience may have an impact on NSSI behaviors (Gomez & Freyd, 2013), but little work has examined the potential relationship between betrayal trauma and NSSI. This cross-sectional study examined the association between history of high betrayal trauma and engagement in NSSI, as well as explored shame and emotion dysregulation as potential mediators of the association. A total of 100 adolescent offenders in Singapore were recruited from a probation setting, and administered measures assessing betrayal trauma, shame, emotion dysregulation, and NSSI behaviors. A history of high betrayal trauma was significantly associated with both lifetime and past-year engagement in NSSI. Mediation analysis using bootstrap resampling indicated that both shame and emotion dysregulation individually mediated the association between high betrayal trauma and frequency of past-year NSSI. In a multiple mediation analysis, emotion dysregulation emerged as a significant mediator of the association, whereas shame did not. The findings highlight the importance of betrayal trauma as a correlate of NSSI, and point to emotion dysregulation as a key mechanism underlying the relationship between betrayal trauma and NSSI.

AB Purpose Emotional functions may play an important role in anorexia nervosa (AN). The onset of the disorder generally occurs during adolescence, which is a critical period of emotional development. However, most studies that evaluated emotional functions in AN were conducted in adult patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate emotion regulation, emotion recognition, and empathy skills in adolescent girls with AN by controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security on emotional functions.
   Methods Thirty-two adolescent girls with AN and 32 healthy counterparts completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Child and Adolescent KA-SI Empathic Tendency Scale-Adolescent Form.
   Results The results revealed that adolescents with AN were found to have more difficulties in emotion regulation, higher alexithymic tendencies, and lower empathy skills compared with the control group. However, emotion recognition was not found to be significantly different between the two groups. These results were the same when controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security except for empathy skills. Alexithymia and depressive symptoms were significantly related to emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents with AN.
   Conclusions Considering the results, it seems that emotion regulation and alexithymia may play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of AN. Accordingly, it is necessary to focus on the improvement of these skills during the treatment of AN. Furthermore, interventions promoting these skills during adolescence may be preventive.

AB Parents play irreplaceable roles in the shaping of social-emotional competence in adolescents, particularly in economically disadvantaged families. By surveying a sample of 965 adolescents from Hong Kong, China, we found that the associations between parenting behaviors and the social-emotional competence of their children varied by gender; that is, the associations between parenting behaviors and the social-emotional competence of female were much stronger as opposed to male students. Specifically, the magnitude of the positive association between positive parenting behaviors and social-emotional competence in female adolescents was larger than that in male adolescents. Similarly, the magnitude of the negative association between negative parenting behaviors and social-emotional competence among female adolescents was also larger than that of male adolescents. This difference can be explained by different interpretations of social-emotional competence, along with different opportunities for social practice across genders in communities based on traditional Chinese culture.

AB Objectives Research has shown a link between parental and offspring internalizing problems and that parental warmth and overprotection affect these relationships. However, less research has examined how parental warmth and overprotection affect the link between parental internalizing problems and irritability in adolescents. Thus, the current study investigated the moderating effect of parental warmth and overprotection on the relationship between parental internalizing problems and adolescent irritability in the context of parent and child gender. Methods Participants were parents of adolescents aged 10-24 years and completed surveys online about themselves, the adolescent, and the adolescent's other primary caregiver. Questionnaires assessed parental warmth and overprotection, parental internalizing problems, and adolescent irritability. Results Results indicated a moderating effect of parental warmth (b = -0.08, p< 0.01) and overprotection (b = 0.21, p< 0.01) on the relationship between parental internalizing problems and adolescent irritability. Parent and child gender further moderated the relationship when examining parental overprotection (b = -0.16, p< 0.01) but not parental warmth. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of examining factors, such as parental internalizing problems, warmth, and overprotection, that influence the development of irritability symptoms in adolescents. Additionally, results highlight the importance of examining how gender moderates these relationships. For example, the effect of maternal overprotection on male adolescents was particularly important, which suggests that more research should be done to further understand the complex nature of this relationship.

AB Emotion dysregulation has been associated with increased risks for psychopathology. During adolescence when the onset of mental illnesses peak, emotion dysregulation may be particularly problematic. In this study, we examined transactional associations between young adolescents' self-report of their emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression at three assessments over 3 years. Participants were 391 Australian students (56% female; 79% White/Caucasian) in Grades 6 to 8 followed until Grades 9 to 11. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), emotion dysregulation was a latent variable indicated by lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior. A sixth aspect of emotion dysregulation, lack of emotional awareness, which was not correlated with the other five subscales, was examined separately in the SEM. Transactional associations over time were identified between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression, with adolescents higher in emotion dysregulation at Time 1 (T1) reporting higher social anxiety and depressive symptoms between T1 and Time 2 (T2), and T2 emotion dysregulation predicting increases in adolescents' depression, but not social anxiety, symptoms from T2 to Time 3 (T3), after controlling for baseline symptoms. In addition, earlier social anxiety, but not depressive, symptom level at T2 was significantly associated with later emotion dysregulation between T2 and T3, after baseline emotion dysregulation was controlled. Furthermore, girls were higher in emotion dysregulation, social anxiety, and depression than boys, but sex did not moderate temporal links between emotion dysregulation and symptoms.

AB When compared to one another, multiple informants' reports of adolescent internalizing problems often reveal low convergence. This creates challenges in the delivery of clinical services, particularly for severe outcomes linked to internalizing problems, namely suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Clinicians would benefit from methods that facilitate interpretation of multi-informant reports, particularly in inpatient settings typified by high-cost care and high-stakes decision-making. 765 adolescent inpatients (70.3% female; M-age = 14.7) and their parents completed measures of adolescent internalizing problems. We obtained baseline clinical and treatment characteristics from electronic medical records. Latent class analysis revealed four reporting patterns: Parent-Adolescent Low (LL; 49.0%), Parent Low-Adolescent High (PL-AH; 11.5%), Parent High-Adolescent Low (PH-AL; 21.8%), Parent-Adolescent High (HH; 17.6%). Relative to the LL class, adolescents in the PH-AL and PL-AH classes were more likely to be admitted with suicidality. In terms of treatment characteristics and relative to the LL class, HH and PH-AL adolescents were more likely to receive standing antipsychotics, PH-AL adolescents were more likely to be in seclusion, and HH adolescents had longer hospital stays. At discharge and relative to the LL class, HH, PH-AL, and PL-AH adolescents were more likely to receive an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Further, HH, PH-AL, and PL-AH adolescents were more likely to receive partial hospitalization or care in another restrictive environment after inpatient treatment, relative to the LL class. This naturalistic study informs clinical decision-making by aiding our understanding of how multi-informant reports facilitate interpretations of adolescents' clinical presentations as well as predictions about treatment characteristics.

AB Emerging literature suggests fathers may contribute uniquely to child development and emotional health through play. In the present study, a multiple mediational model was analyzed using data from 476 families that participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. After accounting for infant-mother attachment, infant temperament, and family income and stability, a significant indirect effect from father-child play quality to adolescent internalizing symptoms was found through father-reported child emotional dysregulation, B = -.05, 95% confidence interval; CI [-.14, -.01]. Specifically, in first grade, dyads where fathers were rated highly on sensitivity and stimulation during play, and children demonstrated high felt security and affective mutuality during play, had children with fewer father-reported emotional dysregulation problems in third grade, B = -.23, 95% CI [-.39, -.06]. Children with fewer emotional dysregulation problems had lower self-reported internalizing symptoms at age 15, B = .23, 95% CI [.01, .45]. Mothers' ratings of children's emotional dysregulation were not a significant mediator. Results are discussed regarding the importance of father-child play for children's adjustment as well as the usefulness of inclusion of fathers in child developmental research.

AB There is increasing evidence for multiple pathways in the development of callous-unemotional (CU) features, including primary and secondary profiles. Understanding affect regulation strategies among variants may provide further insight to the development and treatment of CU features. This study evaluated whether profiles of CU features could be identified within a clinical sample of youth using measures of affect dysregulation, affect suppression, anxiety, and maltreatment. We also examined whether these profiles were consistent across gender. Participants (N = 418; 56.7% female) ranged in age from 12 to 19 years (M = 15.04, SD = 1.85) and were drawn from a clinical sample. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted using five indicators, including affect regulation, suppression, anxiety, CU features, and maltreatment. The best fitting model, a four-profile solution, included a low (low CU/dysregulation), anxious (low CU/high dysregulation), primary CU (high CU/low dysregulation), and secondary CU profile (high CU/dysregulation/maltreatment). LPAs found the same four-profile model when conducted separately for males and females. This is the first study to examine gender and include affect regulation strategies in the examination of primary and secondary profiles of CU.

AB Background Social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents may be associated with the use of maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies. The present study examined the use of maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies in adolescents with SAD. Methods 30 adolescents with SAD (CLIN) and 36 healthy adolescents for the control group (CON) aged between 11 and 16 years were assessed with the standardized questionnaires PHOKI (Phobiefragebogen fur Kinder und Jugendliche) for self-reported fears as well as FEEL-KJ (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen) for different emotion regulation strategies. Results Compared to controls, adolescents with SAD used adaptive ER strategies significantly less often, but made use of maladaptive ER strategies significantly more often. There was a significant positive correlation between maladaptive ER and social anxiety in adolescents. Examining group differences of single ER strategy use, the CLIN and CON differed significantly in the use of the adaptive ER strategy reappraisal with CLIN reporting less use of reappraisal than CON. Group differences regarding the maladaptive ER strategies withdrawal and rumination, as well as the adaptive ER strategy problem-solving were found present, with CLIN reporting more use of withdrawal and rumination and less use of problem-solving than CON. Conclusions Promoting adaptive emotion regulation should be a central component of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy-CBT) for social anxiety in adolescents from the beginning of the therapy process. These findings provide rationale for special therapy programs concentrating on the establishment of different adaptive ER strategies (including reappraisal). As an increased use of maladaptive ER may be associated with SAD in adolescents, it may be paramount to focus on reduction of maladaptive ER (for example withdrawal and rumination) from the beginning of the psychotherapy process. Incorporating more ER components into psychotherapy (CBT) could increase the treatment efficacy. Further investigations of the patterns of emotion regulation in specific anxiety groups like SAD in adolescents is needed to continue to optimize the psychotherapy (CBT) concept.

AB Background: Previous studies revealed that female adolescents are more likely than males to engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) to regulate negative emotions; however, the dimensions of emotion regulation that are associated with NSSI behavior in adolescents require further examination. The present study aimed to identify Taiwanese female adolescent clusters with NSSI engagement frequency and to evaluate the association of specific forms of emotion dysregulation with NSSI. Methods: The participants were 438 female adolescents (mean age = 15.23 years, SD = 1.24, range between 13 and 18) recruited from 11 high schools. Self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, difficulties in emotion regulation, and positive and negative affect were administered, and 37% of respondents reported a history of NSSI. Results: The analysis of NSSI frequency yielded three groups: severe, moderate, and non-NSSI. High negative affect, low positive affect, and difficulties in all aspects of emotion regulation differentiated female adolescents in the severe NSSI group from their counterparts in the non-NSSI group. The moderate and severe NSSI groups were further distinguished by age of onset, negative affect, emotion regulation strategies, and impulse control. Adolescents classified in the severe group reported earlier onset of NSSI, higher negative affect, less emotion regulation strategies, and more difficulty with impulse control. Conclusions: The results indicate that assessments of NSSI and emotion regulation should be incorporated in youth mental health screening. The clinical implications of NSSI behavior intervention require further discussion.

AB The purpose of the current study was to identify how defending behaviors in bullying overlap with bullying behaviors and victimization experiences using an empirical approach. Furthermore, an additional goal was to examine internalizing problems associated with these bullying role behaviors. Data on students' defending and bullying behaviors, victimization experiences, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem were collected from 700 sixth- through eighth-grade students using the Bully Participant Behaviors Questionnaire, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders-Child Version, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results of a latent profile analysis identified the following roles: defenders, bully-victim-defenders, and students who had low involvement in bullying, victimization, and defending. Results documented significant differences in internalizing problems among the roles. Specifically, bully-victim-defenders reported higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem than did defenders and students who had low involvement with bullying scenarios.

AB Objectives The current study investigated the mediating role of emotion regulation and empathy between attachment styles and dark personality traits.
   Methods In total, 350 teenage students from Bushehr schools were selected based on convenience sampling method in the academic year of 2017-18. Then, dark traits test, emotional dysregulation, attachment styles, and empathy were distributed among research participants to respond. Collected data were analyzed by correlation indicators and path analysis in LISREL software.
   Results There was a significant correlation between the components of dark personality traits, empathy, emotional dysregulation, and attachment styles (P<0.05). Moreover, path analysis modeling indicated the mediating role of emotional dysregulation and empathy in the relationship between attachment styles and dark traits (P<0.05).
   Conclusion The obtained results supported the hypothesis that attachment styles lead to dark traits tendencies and emotional dysregulation. Furthermore, empathy can have a moderating role in this regard.

AB This study evaluates a model linking shyness, aspects of peer relations, and internalizing problems among young adolescents in the People's Republic of China. Participants were 547 young adolescents from Shanghai, China (46% boys; M-age = 10.35 years, SD = 0.77 years) who completed peer nominations of shyness, rejection, and victimization, and self-report measures of loneliness, depression, and friendship support. Analyses demonstrated that peer difficulties (rejection, victimization) mediated the associations between shyness and internalizing problems. However, moderated mediation analyses revealed a protective effect for highly supportive friendships, especially for boys. Findings highlight the importance of considering different types of peer experiences in studies of shy young adolescents and are discussed in terms of importance to theory and intervention in China and elsewhere.

AB Objectives. - This research aims to compare coping strategies (strategies developed to cope with stress) and temperamental dimensions used by children and adolescents have not been maltreated and those who have been. The aim of these analyzes is to identify the effects of age as well as vulnerabilities and resources for children and adolescents who have been maltreated.
   Materials and methods. - A total of 232 children and adolescents aged 7 to 16 years participated in this study including 115 who have never been maltreated (control group) and 117 have been maltreated and are living in foster care (placed group). Each young people responded to a scale measuring the frequency of coping strategies (Kidcope) as well as a questionnaire of temperament (questionnaire d'auto- et d'hetero-evaluation du temperament en sept facteurs pour l'enfant d'age scolaire et l'adolescent).
   Results. - An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each coping strategy and temperamental dimension to evaluate the consequence of maltreatment on the emotional regulation, according to the slice of age. The age-based comparison of control and placed groups reveals major differences in the use of certain coping strategies as well as in the temperamental dimensions of maltreated children and adolescents. This confirms that the child's life experience influences his way of understanding his environment and affects his individual resources.
   Conclusions. - The results show vulnerabilities of emotional regulation for children and adolescents who have been maltreated. These aspects underline the importance to think about supports in order to promote the development of some coping strategies and to reduce the stressors. These points will be discussed with preventive and therapeutic used to improve coping skills and emotional regulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Prior work has suggested that individuals with deficits in emotion regulation skills are prone to compulsive behaviour and to following maladaptive coping strategies, such as smartphone overuse, to manage negative moods. Adolescence is a vulnerable developmental stage for deficits in emotion regulation, and these are linked to excessive smartphone use. The present study is the first to examine the links between the use of specific cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies and problematic smartphone use in a sample of adolescents. A total of 845 Spanish adolescents (455 females) completed the Spanish versions of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Smartphone Addiction Scale, along with a socio-demographic survey. The adolescents were divided into two groups: Non-problematic smartphone users (n = 491, 58.1%) and problematic smartphone users (n = 354, 41.9%). Significant group differences were found, with the problematic users reporting significantly higher scores for all maladaptive CER strategies, including higher self-blame, rumination, blaming of others and catastrophising. The results from logistic regression analyses show that rumination, catastrophising and blaming of others were the most important variables for distinguishing between the two groups, along with gender and parental control outside the home. In summary, these findings suggest the importance of specific maladaptive CER strategies in problematic smartphone use and provide insight for relevant targets for intervention designs.

AB The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) comprising 36 items has been widely used across age, gender, psychopathology, language, and culture. Recently several alternative abridged forms have been introduced, namely, the DERS-16 (Bjureberg et al. 2016), the DERS-SF (Kaufman et al. 2016), and the DERS-18 (Victor and Klonsky, 2016), each composed of 16 or 18 items, to provide researchers and clinicians with a shorter measure of emotion dysregulation. However, no study to date has directly compared the psychometrics of these alternative forms. In the present study, using confirmatory factor analysis we first examined the factor structure of the four models of the DERS in two inpatient samples of 636 adolescents in the age-range of 12-17 years (M = 15.33, SD = 1.43), and 1807 adults in the age-range of 18-76 years (M = 34.86, SD = 14.63) with severe mental illness. Next, measurement invariance was tested comparing the two age groups across the four models of DERS. Only the DERS-SF established metric and scalar measurement invariance.

AB While emotional and behaviorial problems increase risks to youth development, resilience helps youth adapt and overcome adversity. Research has discussed factors related to youth resilience, emotional problems, and behaviorial problems; however, existing literature excludes non-western sociocultural contexts and has not explored the potential relations among mindfulness and life skills. This study examines the effects of mindfulness and life skills on resilience, emotional problems, and behaviorial problems of adolescents in China. Our data come from a group-administered survey among 60 adolescents from a school for behaviourally delinquent students in Beijing, China, in 2017. The regression results indicate that mindfulness is associated with reduced adolescent emotional and behaviorial problems, whereas life skills are associated with increased resilience. The findings suggest the importance of adolescent interventions that incorporate concepts from both mindfulness and life skills training.

AB Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8 to 17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional MRI. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.

AB The current study examined the moderating role of friendship quality on the relation between maternal anxiety and internalizing symptoms in a 3-year prospective study of adolescent development. Participants included 177 adolescents (M-age = 16.05, SDage = 0.91) and their mothers. Mothers reported their own levels of anxiety; youth completed self-reports of internalizing symptoms and friendship quality. Positive friendship quality moderated the relation between maternal anxiety and initial levels of internalizing symptoms. Maternal anxiety was associated with steeper increases in internalizing symptoms over time, but only for those with greater negative peer interactions. Findings underscore the important role of both parental and peer relationships in the development of internalizing symptoms and highlight specific avenues for clinical interventions.

AB There is sound evidence that increased level of peer support is linked negatively with youth vulnerably to internalizing and externalizing problems. Conversely, victimization by peers is associated positively with youth adjustment difficulties. The current study examines the mediating role of victimization in the association between classmates' support and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and the moderating role of gender in that association. The study is based on a sample of 243 7th grade Canadian adolescents. The results show that classmates' support has a unique contribution to reduced adolescents' internalizing behaviors above and beyond the effects of parental and teachers' support. This association was partially mediated by youth victimization. Classmates' support was a stronger predictor of internalizing behaviors among females compared to males. With respect to externalizing behaviors, the results indicated that while classmates' support has no direct association with that outcome, parental support plays a central role in predicting externalizing behaviors. The association between classmates' support and externalizing behavior was fully mediated by youth victimization. The current study highlights the importance of support by peers, with whom they interact on a regular basis, to adolescents' well-being and functioning. The results also indicate that parents are still significant figures in adolescents' lives. Those facts should be taken into account when intervening with young people.

AB There is a dearth of research examining the relation between adolescent peer victimization and internalizing symptoms during emerging adulthood. This retrospective study examined relations among offline and online peer victimization, internalizing symptoms, as well as offline and online social support. A sample of 416 participants aged 18-24 was recruited and self-report data on adolescent victimization, support, and internalizing symptoms were collected. The results showed that retrospective reports of peer victimization and social support predicted current internalizing symptomology. However, this varied as a function of online/offline context and symptomology. Specifically peer victimization was more predictive of depressive symptoms than social anxiety symptoms. Offline social support predicted fewer internalizing symptoms, but online support did not. Social support diminished the association between peer victimization and social anxiety.

AB Objective We examined if the links between adolescents' parental attachment and depressive symptoms are mediated by emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and identified which mediator has a stronger mediation effect. Method The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the "Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale" were distributed to 1955 Chinese adolescents (about 50% boys; 49% in senior high school; aged 10-20 years, M = 14.85 +/- 2.86 years) from seven provinces. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, regression analyses, and mediation analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Results The results showed that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression partially mediated the associations between paternal and maternal attachment and depressive symptoms after controlling for grade and sex. Further, the indirect effects of parental attachment through cognitive reappraisal were stronger than those through expressive suppression. Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents with secure parental attachment (vs. insecure) have a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms and that increasing use of cognitive reappraisal and decreasing use of expressive suppression may help adolescents reduce their depressive symptoms.

AB The current study identified profiles of trait mindfulness in a sample of 514 early Chinese adolescents (mean age = 10.54 years), and examined their associations with emotion regulation. Latent profile model was built on five facets of mindfulness (observing, non-judging, acting with awareness, describing, and non-reactivity). Results showed negative correlations of the five facets among the four identified profiles: Judging & High Mindfulness (Profile 1, 43.1%), Non-reacting Observing (Profile 2, 6.7%), Non-judging & Low Mindfulness (Profile 3, 20.4%), and Non-judgmental Awareness (Profile 4, 29.7%). Judging & High Mindfulness and Non-reacting Observing profile used significantly more reappraisal than the other profiles. Besides, Non-reacting Observing applied significantly more behavioral suppression than the other profiles. The result indicated diverse patterns of trait mindfulness among the early adolescents, and the associations of trait mindfulness with emotion regulation should be considered comprehensively with all facets, rather than separately.

AB Objective: Recent research has documented cultural differences in the extent and manner in which various forms of emotion regulation are linked with psychological well-being. Most of these studies, however, have been cross-sectional, nor have they directly examined the values underlying the use of emotion regulation. The present study examined emotion restraint values and their interactions with life stress in predicting internalizing symptoms across time among Vietnamese American and European American adolescents. The study focused on adolescence as a critical developmental period during which life stress and internalizing symptoms increase significantly. Method: Vietnamese American (n = 372) and European American (n = 304) adolescents' levels of emotion restraint values, internalizing symptoms, and stress were assessed at two timepoints six months apart. Results: Results indicated differential associations between emotion restraint values, stress, and symptoms over time for the two groups. For Vietnamese American adolescents, emotion restraint values did not predict depressive, anxiety, or somatic symptoms. For European American adolescents, emotion restraint values predicted higher somatic symptoms but buffered against the effects of interpersonal stress on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide increased understanding of the role of values related to emotion restraint in shaping adolescent internalizing symptoms and responses to stress across cultural groups. Implications of the findings for guiding intervention efforts are discussed.

AB Inconsistencies exist regarding the relation between physical activity (PA) and internalizing symptomology in early adolescence, and there is need for investigation of potential moderators that may account for these discrepancies. The current study utilized a Self-Determination Theory Framework to investigate the main effects of five key motivations to exercise and their moderating effects between PA and internalizing problems in an underserved sample of adolescents (n = 167; mean age = 12.19 years; 73% African American). Analyses showed that intrinsic motivations were negatively related to internalizing problems and extrinsic motivations were positively related. PA was only protective against internalizing problems when intrinsic motivations were high and had iatrogenic effects when these were low. Exploratory analyses further delineated the unique effects of motivational orientations. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB During adolescence there is a relatively high prevalence of weight problems and eating disorders. Furthermore, body image plays an important role in weight control and eating behaviors as well as in mental health. This study analyses the influence of body mass index, perception of being overweight, and body image satisfaction (BIS) on internalizing symptoms related to mental health in adolescents. In addition, sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), dieting, and physical activity are taken into consideration. This research is based on the international study Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC). The sample consists of 4531 Spanish adolescents from 13 to 18 years old. Participants were selected through random multi-stage sampling stratified by conglomerates. Two instruments were employed: the HBSC questionnaire and the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, ASEBA). Results demonstrated that BIS -the emotional component related to body image- was the main predictor of adolescent internalizing symptoms. In addition, results show double-inequalities according to the interaction effects of sex, age, and SES. Likewise, interesting results are shown regarding how dieting behaviors to lose or gain weight/volume and physical activity relate to body image perception and satisfaction, as well as with internalizing symptoms. This study highlights important body image aspects relevant to intervention and prevention of internalized mental health problems in adolescence.

AB As they respond to children's emotions, mothers socialize children's emerging emotion regulation. Mothers' own autobiographical narratives likely reflect in part habitual ways of expressing and managing emotions-ways that may in turn influence the way mothers respond to their children's emotions. We examined features of mothers' narratives about parental pride and regret experiences, and assessed whether these were associated with parental socialization of emotion and the emotion regulation repertoire of their children. Two hundred thirty-seven mothers with children ranging from 8 to 17 years of age provided two narratives about parental pride and parental regret experiences. Parental emotion socialization and children's emotion regulation were assessed via self- and informant-report using a multi-measure, multi-observer approach. We found that features of the way mothers narrated their experiences with a particular child related to their parenting of that child, and that child's emotion regulation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for emotion-related parenting, and the potential importance of parent narratives.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation have been identified as an underlying mechanism in mental health. This pilot study aimed at examining whether group skills training in emotion regulation for adolescents and parents as an add-on intervention was feasible in an outpatient child and adolescent psychiatric clinic. We also investigated if the treatment increased knowledge and awareness of emotions and their functions, increased emotion regulation skills and decreased self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Six skills training groups were piloted with a total of 20 adolescents and 21 adults. The treatment consisted of five sessions dealing with psychoeducation about emotions and emotion regulation skills training. Paired-samples t test was used to compare differences between before-and-after measures for adolescents and parents separately. The primary outcome measure, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, showed significant improvement after treatment for both adolescents and parents. For adolescents, measures of alexithymia were significantly reduced. Also, emotional awareness was significantly increased. Measures of depression and anxiety did not change. In conclusion, group skills training as an add-on treatment can be feasible and effective but further studies are needed.

AB Objective: ADHD and depression co-occur at higher than chance levels in adolescence, but moderators of this association are not well understood. Consistent with a developmental-transactional framework, one such moderator may be maternal emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Using latent growth curve modeling, the current study examined the independent and interactive effects of adolescent ADHD symptoms and maternal ER difficulties on the trajectory of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Method: This study included a community sample of 247 adolescents (M-age = 13.06 years) assessed annually over a 6-year period. Results: Findings suggested that youth with greater ADHD symptoms whose mothers evidenced more ER difficulties demonstrated steeper increases in depressive symptoms over time relative to their peers with lower ADHD symptoms or whose mothers reported fewer ER difficulties. Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of maternal ER difficulties in predicting the trajectory of depressive symptoms among adolescents with ADHD symptomatology.

AB Background: An abnormal interaction between cognition and emotion may contribute to the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Aims: In this study, we aimed to evaluate theory of mind and emotion regulation skills in adolescents diagnosed with OCD. In addition, the results were evaluated in accordance with patients' insight levels. Methods: This study was conducted with 50 patients, who were aged between 11 and 16 and who were newly diagnosed with OCD and 50 healthy individuals. The Turkish version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime was used to diagnose OCD and other comorbidities. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were used for clinical evaluation. The intelligence levels were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Short Form. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was used in patients. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was also used to evaluate the skills of regulating emotions. Results: Patients with OCD had lower ability with regard to reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than the healthy individuals. Patients with OCD, who had a poor insight, had more difficulty in reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than those with good insight. Conclusions: This study supports the idea that OCD is related to deficits in theory of mind and emotion regulation skills. Thus, further studies are required to confirm the findings of this study.

AB Introduction: Internalizing mental disorders (IMDs) in HIV+ children and adolescents are associated with impaired quality of life and non-adherence to anti-retroviral treatment. Telomere length is a biomarker of cellular aging, and shorter telomere length has been associated with IMDs. However, the nature of this association has yet to be elucidated.
   Objective: We determined the longitudinal association between IMDs and relative telomere length (rTL) and the influence of chronic stress among Ugandan perinatally HIV-infected youth (PHIY).
   Methods: IMDs (depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder) and IMDs were assessed using the locally adapted Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5. In 368 PHIY with any IMD and 368 age- and sex-matched PHIY controls without any psychiatric disorder, rTL was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to generate the three chronic stress classes (mild, moderate, and severe). t-tests were used to assess the difference between baseline and 12 month rTL and the mean difference in rTL between cases and controls both at baseline and at 12 months. Linear regression analysis was used to model the effects of chronic stress on the association between IMDs and rTL, controlling for age and sex.
   Results: We observed longer rTL among cases of IMDs compared with controls (p < 0.001). We also observed a statistically significant reduction in rTL between baseline and 12 months in the combined sample of cases and controls (p < 0.001). The same statistical difference was observed when cases and controls were individually analyzed (p < 0.001). We found no significant difference in rTL between cases and controls at 12 months (p = 0.117). We found no significant influence of chronic stress on the association between IMDs and rTL at both baseline and 12 months.
   Conclusion: rTL is longer among cases of IMDs compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We observed a significant attrition in rTL over 12 months, which seems to be driven by the presence of any IMDs. There is a need for future longitudinal and experimental studies to understand the mechanisms driving our findings.

AB Introduction: Youth of color (e.g., Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic) are over-represented in the juvenile justice system and experience greater health disparities compared to non-Hispanic White youth. Ethnic/racial discrimination (ERD) is a risk marker for poor mental health and behavioral outcomes among youth of color, and traumatic stress and emotion dysregulation have been implicated in these pathways. Despite the relevance of these factors for justice-involved youth of color, understanding of their interrelations within this demographic is lacking.
   Methods: Participants were 173 recently arrested adolescents (86% African American; 45% girls; ages 13-18) on probation in a large Midwest city in the United States. Participants completed surveys assessing ERD, traumatic stress, emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Using linear regression and path analysis, this study tested the cross-sectional links among two types of ERD (i.e., interpersonal experiences and perceptions of group experiences), traumatic stress symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors.
   Results: Interpersonal ERD (e.g., hearing racial insults) was associated with increased internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors; for internalizing symptoms, the relation was stronger for girls than boys. Gender differences were partially accounted for by traumatic stress symptoms and emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: This study offers new insights into ERD experiences among juvenile justice-involved youth of color, gender differences in ethnic/racial discrimination experiences, and the potential value of gender-sensitive and culturally responsive programming in strengthening youths' ability to cope with ERD.

AB Objective Emotion dysregulation has been consistently linked to suicide ideation and attempt, but an explanatory model for this relationship has not been adequately investigated in adolescents. This study examined the concurrent relationship among emotion dysregulation, variables from the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), and suicide risk (operationalized as a continuous variable that increases in intensity from nonspecific to active suicide ideation to suicide ideation with a plan) in a clinical adolescent sample. Method A total of 151 adolescents (aged 12-17) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to determine whether the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by the variables of perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness, and capability for suicide, as proposed by the IPTS. Results As hypothesized, the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by PB and capability for suicide. Depressive symptoms had an independent relationship with suicide risk after controlling for IPTS variables. Conclusions The results from this study suggest that effective treatment strategies that reduce negative cognition tied to PB and depressive symptoms would address the most proximal variables related to suicide risk in adolescents. Enhancing emotion management would serve to maintain low levels of proximal influences on risk.

AB Associations between stressful life events (SLEs) and internalizing psychopathology are complex and bidirectional, involving interactions among stressors across development to predict psychopathology (i.e., stress sensitization) and psychopathology predicting greater exposure to SLEs (i.e., stress generation). Although stress sensitization and generation theoretical models inherently focus on within-person effects, most previous research has compared average levels of stress and psychopathology across individuals in a sample (i.e., between-person effects). The present study addressed this gap by investigating stress sensitization and stress generation effects in a multiwave, prospective study of SLEs and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms. Depression, anxiety, and SLE exposure were assessed every 3 months for 2 years (8 waves of data) in a sample of adolescents (n = 382, aged 11 to 15 at baseline). Multilevel modeling revealed within-person stress sensitization effects such that the association between within-person increases in SLEs and depression, but not anxiety, symptoms were stronger among adolescents who experienced higher average levels of SLEs across 2 years. We also observed within-person stress generation effects, such that adolescents reported a greater number of dependent-interpersonal SLEs during time periods after experiencing higher levels of depression at the previous wave than was typical for them. Although no within-person stress generation effects emerged for anxiety. higher overall levels of anxiety predicted greater exposure to dependent-interpersonal SLEs. Our findings extend prior work by demonstrating stress sensitization in predicting depression following normative forms of SLEs and stress generation effects for both depression and anxiety using a multilevel modeling approach. Clinical implications include an individualized approach to interventions.

AB Internalizing difficulties in children and adolescents refer to inner-directed disordered mood and emotions. The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the reliability and validity of the internalizing subscale on the interRAl Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) in assessing broadband internalizing mental health symptoms. Data were collected from clinically-referred children/youths 4 to 18 years of age between 2015 and 2016 (N = 2536). After initial items relevant to internalizing disturbances underwent expert content validation, exploratory first-order and bifactor factor analyses and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) parameterizations were conducted to test the validity of the measurement model. The internalizing subscale demonstrated strong measurement properties for a three-factor structure (i.e., depression, anxiety, anhedonia) and MIRT analyses showed individual items had acceptable discrimination parameters across the latent continuum. A series of four competing models using confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in a separate sample of 1397 children/youth assessed in 2017 and the bifactor model showed superior fit compared to other models. Finally, concurrent validity of this measure was confirmed based on relationships with other established sub scales from criterion measures. The interRAl ChYMH internalizing subscale could be used to provide useful information for triaging and prioritizing referrals for children/youths.

AB Although numerous studies reveal altered respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) among children, adolescents, and adults who exhibit emotion dysregulation, effects of temperamental vulnerability and parental mental health on RSA remain unclear. We evaluated the relationship among emotion regulation, RSA, and RSA reactivity in a pooled sample of 24 vulnerable and 31 resilient adolescents (mean age = 13.69 years; 60% girls), including associations with temperamental vulnerability and parental depressive symptoms. Participants watched a neutral film clip while their resting RSA was recorded, and then completed a reward and frustration task, using an affective Posner paradigm. Temperament and emotion regulation were assessed via self-report and parent report, and parents reported on their own depressive symptoms. Low resting RSA was associated with temperamental negative emotionality, whereas greater RSA reactivity to frustration was associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. No significant relations were found between RSA and parental depressive symptoms. This study elucidates the role of RSA as a biomarker of individual differences in emotion dysregulation and temperamental vulnerability and stresses the importance of considering multiple units of analyses, as well as functional domains, when studying emotional responding and regulation in adolescents.

AB Exposure to threat increases the risk for internalizing problems in adolescence. Deficits in integrating bodily cues into representations of emotion are thought to contribute to internalizing problems. Given the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating bodily responses and integrating them into representations of emotional states, coordination between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and autonomic nervous system responses may be influenced by past threat exposure with consequences for the emergence of internalizing problems. A sample of 179 Mexican-origin adolescents (88 female) reported on neighborhood and school crime, peer victimization, and discrimination when they were 10-16 years old. At age 17, participants underwent a functional neuroimaging scan during which they viewed pictures of emotional faces while respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses were measured. Adolescents also reported symptoms of internalizing problems. Greater exposure to threats across adolescence was associated with more internalizing problems. Threat exposure was also associated with stronger negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and RSA. Stronger negative ventromedial prefrontal cortex-RSA coupling was associated with fewer internalizing problems. These results suggest the degree of coordinated activity between the brain and parasympathetic nervous system is both enhanced by threat experiences and decreased in adolescents with more internalizing problems.

AB Youth's responses to stress are a central feature of risk and resilience across development. The current study examined whether youth coping and stress reactivity moderate the association of current maternal depressive symptoms with youth's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Mothers (M-age=41.58, SD=6.18) with a wide range of depressive symptoms and their children ages 9-15 (M-age=12.25, SD=1.89, 45.3% girls) completed measures of youth symptoms and coping and automatic responses to stress. Mothers also completed a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Youth's primary and secondary control coping, stress reactivity, and involuntary disengagement moderated the association between current maternal depressive symptoms and youth symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with youth's internalizing and externalizing symptoms when youth used low as opposed to high levels of primary and secondary control coping. Conversely, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with youth symptoms for youth with high levels of stress reactivity and involuntary disengagement. The findings suggest interventions focused on improving the use of primary and secondary control coping skills and reducing reactivity and involuntary disengagement to stress may benefit youth with mothers who are experiencing high levels of depressive symptoms.

AB Deficits regulating emotions are a core process underlying both substance use and mental health disorders. Research has focused on identifying one-to-one associations between individual emotion regulation (ER) strategies and mental health symptoms. Consequently, little is known about how patterns of ER relate to a broad range of psychopathology, in treatment seeking young people. Latent class analysis was used to examine patterns of ER strategies and their relationship with symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance use and borderline personality disorder, in a sample of young treatment seekers. Participants were young people (N=306, M=20.8years) accessing youth advocacy and support or mental health services in Australia. Participants recalled an emotionally-arousing event experienced when on their own and indicated their use of 14 possible ER responses in an online questionnaire. Symptoms of mental health and substance use were measured. The LCA identified three distinct classes of ER responses: Ruminators/avoiders (n=76), active regulators (n=81), and low regulators (n=129). The ruminators/avoiders endorsed the most severe symptom picture across all disorders except alcohol use. Within this cohort, distinct patterns of ER responding had unique relationships with symptoms of psychopathology. The deleterious impact of heightened maladaptive ER strategies (rumination and avoidance) in the absence of adaptive strategies was highlighted.

AB Adolescence is a time of unique sensitivity to socially salient stimuli such as social rewards. This period overlaps with the onset of psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In the current studies, we examined behavioral and neural patterns of dysregulation to social rewards and threats, and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths. In study 1, we used a social Go/NoGo cognitive control task using peer faces to test for age-related behavioral differences in inhibitory failures in adolescents (N = 53, M-age = 13.37 years), and adults (N = 51, M-age = 43.71 years). In study 2, an independent adolescent sample (N = 51, M-age = 13.98 years) completed a similar social Go/NoGo cognitive control task during fMRI. Results show that adolescents had greater inhibitory failures - as measured by false alarm rate - to both social reward and threat cues than adults, and more so to social reward than threat cues. Greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues were associated with greater internalizing symptoms, but were not significantly related to externalizing symptoms. At the neural level, greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues as well as greater internalizing symptoms were both associated with heightened amygdala-ventral striatum connectivity. Our findings indicate that subcortico-subcortical connectivity, which is deemed to occur chronologically earlier and thus necessary for subcortico-cortical circuits, may serve as an early biomarker for emotion dysregulation and a risk factor for internalizing symptoms.

AB Background and Objectives: Negative cognitive emotion regulation (ER) strategies are particularly important within the framework of anxiety problems amongst youths and how they cope with stressful events. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between both negative and positive ER style and cardiac regulation under stressful conditions. Design: Eighty-nine adolescents (M = 13.31 years, SD = 0.68, 44.94% girls) were exposed to a socially relevant stress induction protocol. Methods: Participants' emotion regulation strategies were assessed and their cardiac function was recorded. Results: A negative ER style predicted heart rate (HR) entropy at the stressful stage after controlling for anxiety scores. In addition, heart rate variability reactivity and recovery and HR entropy recovery were larger (p < .05) in the low negative ER style group (n = 16) than in the high negative ER style group (n = 23). Conclusions: Results suggest that individuals with a highly negative ER style have diminished autonomic flexibility.

AB Emotional awareness is an important variable for children's and adolescents' social and emotional development. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties (e.g., factor structure, internal consistencies) of scores on the German translation of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (EAQ; Rieffe, Oosterveld, Miers, Meerum Terwogt, & Ly, 2008). Furthermore, to examine the concurrent validity, associations of the six subscales (Differentiating Emotions, Verbal Sharing of Emotions, Not Hiding Emotions, Bodily Unawareness, Attending to Others' Emotions, Analyses of Emotions) with emotion regulation, internalizing and externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior were investigated. Questionnaire data of 1,018 adolescents aged between 11 and 18 were analyzed. The proposed six-factor structure was replicated and internal consistencies were satisfactory. Meaningful associations of the six EAQ subscales with emotion regulation and psychosocial adjustment were found, proving the concurrent validity of this questionnaire. In general, higher emotional awareness was associated with more functional emotion regulation and prosocial behavior, and less dysfunctional emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing problems. Significant gender differences were detected and are discussed. Overall, the findings suggest that the German EAQ is a useful instrument to assess children's and adolescents' emotional awareness.

AB Objective: The association between violence exposure and health risk behaviours in South African adolescents, and the moderating role of emotion dysregulation were investigated. Design: A multi-ethnic sample of adolescents (N = 925: boy: 47.3%, girl: 52.7%, M age = 16 years, SD = 1.54) completed a survey. Main outcome measures: Violence exposure across different contexts (home-, school-, community-, political victimisation), emotion dysregulation (inability to regulate sadness and anger) and a composite measure of health risk behaviours (smoking, substance use, risky sexual behaviour) were examined. Results: Boys reported more risk behaviours than girls, t (844) = 5.25, p < 0.001. Direct community victimisation was a predictor for boys' risk behaviours, B = 0.22, p < 0.001. Indirect school victimisation and direct community victimisation were predictors for girls' risk behaviours, B's = 0.19, p's < 0.01. Girls reported higher emotion dysregulation than boys, t (748) = -2.95, p < 0.01. Only for girls, emotion dysregulation moderated the associations of indirect home victimisation, B = 16, p < 0.01, and direct community victimisation, B = 15, p < 0.05, with risk behaviours. Conclusion: Interventions may target emotion regulation skills, particularly for girls, to enhance resilience to the negative effects of violence on behaviours.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 29 years. Specifically, the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology is related to increased risk for suicide at these ages. Few studies have analyzed the relations between these symptoms and their role as mediators in predicting suicide behavior. This study aimed to examine the relation between internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and suicide behaviors through a longitudinal study. The sample consisted of 238 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. The data were analyzed via the PROCESS Statistical Package. The main results showed that previous depression symptoms had a significant indirect effect, through previous suicide behaviors and current depression symptoms, on current suicide behaviors, accounting for 61% of the total variance explained. Additionally, being a girl increased this risk. Therefore, the implementation of early identification and intervention programs to address youth symptoms of depression and suicidal behaviors could significantly reduce the risk for future suicidal behaviors in adolescence.

AB This study tested the specificity of associations between childhood multi-trajectories of shyness, anxiety and depression symptoms and adolescent social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, as well as functional impairment. A population sample of 1596 singletons was followed over 15 years. Mothers rated child shyness, anxiety and depression between 11/2 and 8 years-old. Adolescents self-reported symptoms of social phobia, GAD and depression at 15 years-old. Multi-trajectories of childhood internalizing symptoms showed developmental heterogeneity. Controlling for perinatal risk factors, low anxiety and depression in childhood were associated with lower GAD, depression and impairment in adolescence. Higher childhood shyness was associated with adolescent social phobia. Higher shyness in girls was a protective factor for GAD, depression and impairment due to depression, while low shyness in boys was linked to higher risk for GAD and impairment due to depression. Our results underline the importance of distinguishing between shyness and different internalizing symptoms.

AB Objective: Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important risk factor for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Various SES parameters are included in research efforts.This paper investigates the predictive value of different individual SES measures and the combination thereof regarding internalizing and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents. Method: We used data from N = 381 8- to 14-yearolds who had been recruited in child and adolescent psychiatric facilities and in the general population. Based oun a diagnostic parent interview (K-SADS-PL), we divided the sample into internalizing and externalizing groups and a healthy control group. The SES data of both parents were collected. Education, occupational status, and income were integrated as single factors as well as combined factor to form the SES index. Additionally, we assessed unemployment. Results: Using multivariate analyses, we controlled for age and sex. All single factors turned out to be significant risk factors for internalizing and externalizing disorders. Occupational status was the most important single factor. The explained variance for the SES index was as high as for occupational status. Unemployment was not predictive when examined simultaneously with the SES index. Conclusion: Future studies should integrate the SES as risk factor and use the SES index or occupational status as single factor.The integration of unemployment is not necessarily needed.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been found to be associated with poor emotion regulation. Aims: The goal of this study was to examine the association of multidimensional cognitive emotion regulation strategies with NSSI among adolescents and compare the different patterns of NSSI. Method: A sample of 594 high-school students (54.4% boys; mean age = 14.96 years), from five regional schools across Israel, were assessed for five facets of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance, refocus on planning, positive refocusing, putting into perspective, and positive reappraisal) and NSSI behaviors using validated scales. Participants were allocated into three groups: repetitive NSSI (more than six occasions of NSSI; 7.1%), occasional NSSI (at least one incident but less than six; 8.3%), and no NSSI (84.6%). Results: Analysis of covariance, controlling for gender and depression symptoms, revealed that students with NSSI reported higher levels of acceptance, but lower levels of refocus on planning and putting into perspective. Limitations: The study used a cross-sectional design, which was a limitation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that particular cognitive emotion regulation strategies differ substantially in their relationship with NSSI. Adolescents who focus on planning and putting stressful situations into perspective may have increased resilience, whereas adolescents who are accepting of negative events that have happened may be more prone to maladaptive coping behaviors.

AB Adolescents with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD) experience difficulties with socio-emotional adjustment, including compromised friendships, feelings of loneliness, and depression. Using a sample of 127 adolescents with HFASD and their parents, this study is first to examine: (1) relations between organized activity (OA) involvement and adjustment and (2) whether these relations were moderated by social impairment and executive functions. Results indicated that greater intensity, breadth, and academic OA involvement were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. OA intensity was also associated with less loneliness. For adolescents with better emotional control, greater intensity was associated with better friendship quality. Results suggest that for adolescents with HFASD, more involvement in OA is associated with better socio-emotional adjustment even after accounting for risk factors.

AB Background: Maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment affect parenting and have consequences for a child's social-emotional development. Adolescent mothers have a higher frequency of a history of maltreatment than adult mothers. However few studies have analyzed the interactions between adolescent mothers with a history of childhood maltreatment and their infants.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment on mother-infant emotion regulation at infant 3 months, considering both infant and mother individual emotion regulation and their mutual regulation.
   Participants: Participants were 63 adolescent and young adult mother-infant dyads recruited at a hospital.
   Methods: The mothers were administered the Adult Attachment Interview to evaluate reflective functioning and attachment and the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse was used to evaluate maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment. Mother-infant interactions were coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver Engagement Phases.
   Results: Dyads with mothers with childhood maltreatment (vs dyads with mothers with no maltreatment) spent more time in negative emotional mutual regulation (p = .009) and less time in positive and neutral mutual emotion regulation (p = .019). Cumulative maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment were associated positively with mother and infant negative states at individual and dyadic level and with the AAI scales of Passivity and Unresolved Trauma (p < .05). The effect of cumulative maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment on mother infant emotion regulation was direct and not mediated by maternal attachment and reflective function.
   Conclusions: Maternal childhood experiences of maltreatment increase the risk connected to early motherhood, affecting mother-infant emotion regulation.

AB The present study investigated whether bullying victimization and parental involvement were associated with internalizing distress, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and substance use in Jamaican adolescents as well as whether parental involvement moderated the relation between bullying victimization and measures of psychological and behavioral distress. Analyses were based on a sample of 1,595 adolescents who were participating in the 2010 Global School-Based Student Health Survey. Data were collected using a complex survey design. Regression models were estimated using weighted data, which allowed us to draw conclusions about the population of Jamaican adolescents. Consistent with findings from international studies, bullying victimization was uniquely and positively associated with feelings of loneliness, sleep difficulties due to worry, smoking frequency, and suicidality for both male and female adolescents as well as with alcohol use frequency for female adolescents. Our pattern of findings also suggested that parental involvement is a more robust correlate of psychological and behavioral adjustment for female adolescents. Female adolescents who reported higher levels of parental involvement were less lonely and less likely to consider or plan suicide. For boys, parental involvement was only negatively related to loneliness. Finally, we found evidence that parental involvement moderated the relation between bullying victimization and cigarette use and considering suicide, although the latter finding was at the level of a nonsignificant trend. Our findings suggest parental involvement may attenuate the relation between bullying victimization and considering suicide but may strengthen the relation between bullying victimization and smoking. We discuss our findings in the context of Jamaican cultural socialization and with an appreciation for the social challenges faced by adolescents experiencing bullying victimization.

AB Our understanding of the phenomenon of health anxiety in children and adolescents has expanded considerably in recent years. The role emotion regulation may play in the etiology of health anxiety has yet to be explored. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between self-reported health anxiety, emotion regulation, and associated constructs in children and adolescents. The sample was comprised of 79 children and adolescents between the ages of 7 to 15 years (mean age = 10.89 years; SD = 2.11). Participants completed a series of measures examining health anxiety, emotion regulation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression. Statistically significant associations were not observed between health anxiety and emotion regulation; however, some statistically significant associations were demonstrated between anxiety sensitivity and depression and emotion regulation. Statistically significant associations were observed between health anxiety and anxiety sensitivity. This investigation contributes to a more complete understanding of the factors that may or may not contribute to the etiology of health anxiety in children and adolescents. Our findings may be employed to develop evidence-based assessments and interventions for children and adolescents with elevated health anxiety.

AB Adolescents living in rural regions of the United States face substantial barriers to accessing mental health services, creating needs for more accessible, nonstigmatizing, briefer interventions. Research suggests that single-session "growth mind-set" interventions (GM-SSIs)-which teach the belief that personal traits are malleable through effort-may reduce internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. However, GM-SSIs have not been evaluated among rural youth, and their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems have not been assessed within a single trial, rendering their relative benefits for different problem types unclear. We examined whether a computerized GM-SSI could reduce depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problems in female adolescents from rural areas of the United States. Tenth-grade female adolescents (N= 222, M age = 15.2, 38% White, 25% Black, 29% Hispanic) from 4 rural, low-income high schools in the southeastern United States were randomized to receive a 45-min GM-SSI or a computer-based active control program, teaching healthy sexual behaviors. Young women self-reported depression symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problem behaviors at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Relative to the female students in the control group, the students receiving the GM-SSI reported modest but significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms (d = .23) and likelihood of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (d = .29) from baseline to follow-up. GM-SSI effects were nonsignificant for social anxiety symptoms, although a small effect size emerged in the hypothesized direction (d = .21), and nonsignificant for change in conduct problems (d = .01). A free-of-charge 45-min GM-SSI may help reduce internalizing distress, especially depression-but not conduct problems-in rural female adolescents.

AB Mindfulness has been widely linked with psychological well-being in general population. There are emerging studies supporting the relationship between adolescents' mindfulness and their mental health. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness may influence adolescents' psychological distress have only recently been explored, and more related research is still needed. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents' dispositional mindfulness and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The mediating variables were also explored in perspective of two common emotion regulation theories, which were measured through Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). DERS has been used as a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation difficulties. ERQ is also widely accepted to measure the emotion regulation process including dimensions of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Measures assessing mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological distress were administered to 1067 adolescents in mainland China. The results confirmed that adolescents' dispositional mindfulness was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. DERS, especially the sub-dimensions of Acceptance and Strategies, significantly mediated the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Whereas, ERQ including subscales of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression exerted limited mediating effect. These findings provided insights for the potential underlying mechanism between adolescents' mindfulness and psychological distress, demonstrating that DERS might be more pervasive than ERQ. Further research was suggested to explore other mediating variables underlying mindfulness and psychological distress among adolescents and develop mindfulness-based programs to improve adolescents' mindfulness and emotion regulation ability.

AB Background The relationship between emotion regulation deficits and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is well established. Many studies have documented the strong relationship between NSSI and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The relationship between emotion regulation deficits and suicide is less understood, but recent studies indicate a moderate association. This study aimed to examine the relationship between emotion regulation deficits, NSSI behavior, and suicide ideation in an unselected community sample of adolescents. It was expected that NSSI history would moderate the relationship between emotion regulation and future suicide ideation. Methods Data were collected from 367 unselected, community adolescents (mean age = 13). Self-report questionnaires assessed NSSI behavior, emotion regulation deficits, and suicide ideation at two time points, 6 months apart. Results After controlling for suicide ideation at baseline, emotion regulation deficits (experiential avoidance and interoceptive deficits) significantly predicted suicide ideation severity at follow-up, and interactions with NSSI engagement showed support for moderation. Conclusions Results of this study provide insight into the mechanisms of these relationships and have significant clinical implications for the identification of adolescents at risk for suicide behaviors.

AB Existing literature has demonstrated an association between higher adolescent religiousness and lower risk-taking via higher self-regulation. This study sought to elucidate the roles of emotion regulation and executive function as parallel mediators in the link between religiousness and risk-taking in a sample of 167 adolescents (mean age = 14.13 years, 52% male, 82% White at Time 1). Longitudinal results across three waves utilizing structural equation modeling indicated higher religiousness was associated with higher emotion regulation, whereas religiousness was not associated with executive function. Subsequently, higher emotion regulation and executive function were associated with lower risk-taking. Emotion regulation mediated the association between religiousness and risk-taking. The findings highlight religiousness as a contextual protective factor for adolescents.

AB Childhood exposure to parental threatening behaviors places adolescents at greater risk for depression. However, the association between parental threatening behaviors and depressive symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient youth, and potential factors that exacerbate the harmful effects of such parenting, have remained unexplored. One factor that may contribute to depression is low emotional clarity, which is characterized by difficulties recognizing and understanding ones emotions. The current investigation examined the interactive effects of childhood exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and emotional clarity deficits in relation to depressive symptoms among inpatient psychiatric youth who had been exposed to a potentially traumatic event (i.e., exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence). Participants (N = 50, M-age = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51, range 12-17) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, childhood exposure to maternal threatening behavior, and depressive symptoms. A significant interaction was found between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and deficits in emotional clarity in relation to depressive symptom severity. Greater exposure to maternal threatening behaviors was related to more severe depressive symptoms, yet only among children with greater deficits in emotional clarity. Findings underscore the need for interventions that target emotional clarity among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threats.

AB Ethnic minority adolescents receive not only less formal mental health services than their ethnic majority peers but also less school-based mental health services. Little is known about the extent to which adolescents indicate their teachers help them with their mental health problems. The aim of the current study was to investigate ethnic differences in teacher-provided informal help for adolescents' internalizing problems, and whether these could be explained by differences in teacher-reported internalizing problems and teacher-adolescent relationship quality. A sample of adolescents at risk of internalizing problems and their teachers participated in the study (n = 229). Adolescents originated from four ethnic groups in the Netherlands: three ethnic minority groups (Surinamese Dutch, Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch) and the ethnic majority (native Dutch). Results showed that only Moroccan Dutch adolescents reported considerably less informal help from their teachers for their internalizing problems than native Dutch adolescents, whereas Turkish Dutch and Surinamese Dutch adolescents were not found to differ from native Dutch adolescents. Teacher-student relationship quality and teacher-reported internalizing problems could not explain the differences in informal help between Moroccan Dutch and Dutch adolescents. Teachers reported significantly higher levels of conflict in their relationships with Moroccan Dutch than native Dutch adolescents, and for Moroccan Dutch adolescents, higher levels of conflict were associated with lower levels of informal help by the teacher.

AB Introduction: Self-compassion, a trait that involves responding to one's difficulties with care and concern, may offer unique stress coping benefits during the challenges of adolescence.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data from a large adolescent sample within two U.S. school settings (N = 1057; 65% female; 68% white; mean age 14.7 years) to examine whether self-compassion buffers the impact of perceived stress on internalizing symptoms, and secondarily, if these relationships differ by gender.
   Results: Regression analysis revealed self-compassion is inversely related to internalizing symptoms. Moreover, the relationship between stress and depression and anxiety symptoms differed by level of self-compassion. This moderation effect was similar between genders for depressive symptoms, but slightly greater in males compared to females for anxiety.
   Conclusions: These results add to our understanding of self-compassion as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy with potential benefits for youth experiencing stress. Further research is needed to confirm if moderation effects for anxiety differ by gender.

AB This paper presents the translation, adaptation and validation of a broadly used scale to measure emotion regulation strategies (i.e. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Children and Adolescents -ERQ-CA; Gullone & Taffe, 2012) in a sample of early adolescents. The 10-item scale was applied to a sample of 248 adolescents (128 boys) aged 13 to 14 years. Semi-confirmatory factor analysis supported the original two-factor structure: Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression (SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .96). These two factors demonstrate adequate internal consistency and evidence for convergent validity with other scales that refer to emotional intelligence, affect, and behavior. Thus, Cognitive Reappraisal scores were associated with higher self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect and personal adjustment (ps < .05). Conversely, Expressive Suppression scores were associated with lower self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect, and personal adjustment (ps < .01), with higher scores on negative affect, school and clinical maladjustment (ps < .01), as well as stress and depression symptoms (ps < .001). Overall, these findings suggest that the questionnaire may be a useful and reliable instrument for the assessment of emotion regulation strategies in early adolescents for future research in Spanish speaking countries.

AB The present study examined the potential moderating role respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) plays in the relationship between parental marital conflict and adolescents' internalizing problems. To examine this issue, data were collected from 330 adolescents (13-14 years, 182 boys). The Chinese version of the Achenbach Youth Self-Report-2001 and the Chinese version of the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict were used to assess the adolescents' internalizing problems and their perceptions of parental marital conflict. To obtain RSA data, electrocardiogram monitoring was performed on the adolescents at baseline and during a series of stress tasks (watching a film clip depicting marital conflict, a mental arithmetic task, and a speech task). The results indicated that baseline RSA and RSA reactivity to the film clip moderated the relationship between parental marital conflict and internalizing problems in early adolescents. The moderating effect of baseline RSA supported the BSCT hypothesis. Specifically, adolescents with low baseline RSA have both the highest and lowest levels of internalizing problems, depending on the level of marital conflict. In contrast, adolescents with high levels of baseline RSA have moderate levels in internalizing problems, regardless of the level of marital conflict they experience. Similarly, high marital conflict was related to internalizing problems for adolescents with less RSA suppression or RSA augmentation but not for those with greater RSA suppression. This effect was specific to stress related to marital conflict, as RSA reactivity to the mental arithmetic task and speech task did not moderate the relationship between marital conflict and internalizing problems. These findings suggest that certain profile of parasympathetic nervous activity is a risk factor for internalizing problems particularly for those who experience high-conflict environments.

AB Introduction: For parents who have experienced childhood maltreatment, parenting an adolescent may trigger memories of abuse or neglect, intensifying parent-adolescent conflict. This paper extends an earlier report of outcomes from a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Tuning Relationships with Music (TM), an intervention for parent-adolescent dyads where parents have a trauma history and dyads are experiencing conflict, in order to look systemically at dyads' emotion regulation during their musical representation of nonverbal conflict interaction (NCI). Method: The RCT randomly allocated 26 parent-adolescent dyads into intervention or control conditions, and analysed dyads' self-report and observation measures completed at baseline and 4-month post-baseline follow-up. Aims of the current paper were (1) to examine relationships between parents' trauma history, parent-adolescent conflict, parents' reactivity and responsiveness, and dyads' emotion regulation, consistency and predictability during NCI; and (2) whether a systemic music intervention focused on nonverbal communication (NVC) and emotion regulation would change the dynamics of dyads' relational conflict. Results: Higher parents' childhood betrayal trauma and adolescent-reported conflict scores were correlated with predictable NVC sequences whilst dyads were emotionally dysregulated, and parents' reactivity was correlated with dyads' inconsistent NVC during NCI. Post-intervention dyads were more emotionally regulated, consistent and predictable during NCI, reported lower levels of conflict and showed increased parent emotional responsiveness and reduced reactivity. Discussion: Findings indicate that where parents have experienced childhood maltreatment, conflictual parent-adolescent dyads may benefit from intervention focusing on skills that promote emotionally regulated, predictable and consistent NVC during conflict interactions. Trials with a larger sample are warranted.

AB Previous work on the contribution of family environments to adolescent emotion dysregulation has tended to focus on broad parenting characteristics (such as warmth); however, it is possible that day-to-day variability in parenting may also relate to emotion dysregulation. The current study sought to test whether inconsistency in the quality of daily parent-youth interactions related to multiple indices of emotion dysregulation in adolescents. Two-hundred-twenty-two adolescents (ages 13-16; 53% female) participated with one parent. Adolescents completed 14-days of diary reporting on the quality of interactions with their parent (negative/neutral/positive) and their emotion dysregulation experiences for each day. Analyses reveal that, beyond the effects of average interaction quality, adolescents with greater variability in the quality of their interactions with their parent reported greater average emotion dysregulation across the days of diary recording and demonstrated greater variability in their ratings of daily emotion dysregulation. Findings were not accounted for by parental warmth or hostility, parent-reported trait-level emotion regulation, or day-level associations between study variables. In these ways, greater variability - and not merely greater negativity - during interactions between parents and adolescents was related to adolescent emotion dysregulation, suggesting that consistency in parent-adolescent relationships may be an important dimension of psychosocial risk to consider within families.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate whether childhood levels of parental warmth buffer the relationship between parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression and behavioural and emotional adjustment (violent offending, substance use, depression and anxiety) among adolescent boys and girls. Data were drawn from a large self-report school survey conducted among 9th graders in Lower Saxony, Germany (n = 7423). Controlling for socio-demographic factors and risk-seeking, results showed that parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression were related to increased externalizing and internalizing behaviour, while parental warmth was related to decreased anxiety and depression. Perceived parental warmth during childhood buffered effects of parent-to-child verbal aggression on later violent offending. More specifically, the strongest relationship between parent-to-child verbal aggression and externalizing behaviour was found in individuals with low parental warmth. Child and parent gender did not qualify the moderating effect of warmth. Results underscore the need for programmes and policies that promote stable family environments particularly marked by the absence of parent-to-child physical and verbal aggression.

AB Distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity may differentiate among internalizing disorders, though few studies have examined differential associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms while adjusting for their intercorrelation. In an adolescent genetic epidemiological sample (ages 15-21), the present study (N= 848, 56.97% female) examined concurrent associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress) at baseline and prospective, predictive associations of baseline distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology at 2-year follow-up. In addition, the present study assessed distress tolerance with two laboratory-based tasks, a carbon dioxide challenge and the mirror-tracing task, to distinguish between tolerance of physiological and cognitive distress, respectively. Elevated anxiety sensitivity was broadly associated with elevated symptoms of internalizing psychopathology at baseline and prospectively predicted elevated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 2-year follow-up. Higher tolerance of cognitive distress was associated with lower concurrent anxiety symptoms but not with anxiety symptoms at follow-up. The present results clarify previously mixed findings; during adolescence, anxiety sensitivity showed broad concurrent and prospective associations with internalizing disorder risk whereas distress tolerance, specifically regarding cognitive distress, was associated with only elevated concurrent anxiety symptoms.

AB Objective The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP). Methods Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes >=.20 considered meaningful. Results At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.

AB Although the way children/adolescents regulate their emotions (e.g., by eating) may be related to their parents' emotion regulation abilities and parenting practices, little is known about how these parental variables are associated with children/adolescents' emotional eating, particularly when children/adolescents have overweight/obesity. This study explores whether mothers' difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) are associated with emotional eating in children/adolescents with overweight/obesity through mindful parenting skills and children/adolescents' depressive symptoms. The sample includes 379 mother-child/adolescent dyads recruited in public schools and in nutrition outpatient services of pediatric hospitals. Mothers completed self-report measures of DER and mindful parenting, and children/adolescents completed measures of depressive symptoms and emotional eating. Higher levels of mothers' DER were associated with higher levels of children/adolescents' depressive symptoms through lower levels of mindful parenting (indirect effect=0.09, p=0.002, 95% CI [0.03, 0.15]), and higher levels of mindful parenting were associated with lower levels of children/adolescents' emotional eating through lower levels of children/adolescents' depressive symptoms (indirect effect=-0.07, p=0.002, 95% CI [-.12, -.02]). The model was invariant across dyads recruited in schools and in hospitals and across children and adolescents. This study highlights the role of mothers' DER (particularly, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, and lack of emotional awareness) and of mindful parenting (particularly, listening with full attention, emotional awareness of the child, and self-regulation in parenting) on children/adolescents' depressive symptoms and emotional eating. Mothers' emotion regulation and mindful parenting should be further investigated in the pediatric obesity field.

AB In the current study, we compared emotion regulation abilities between post-institutionalized (PI; N = 124) and never-institutionalized non-adopted (NA; N = 172) children and adolescents (7-15 years). We assessed cortisol reactivity and coded emotion regulation during the speech portion of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-M). Parents reported on their children's social, academic, and behavioral adjustment. Results suggest that emotion regulation abilities increased with age, but this increase was greater for NA than PI youth. With regard to cortisol, piecewise growth modeling revealed that at higher levels of emotion regulation PI youth had greater baseline values (after a period of time allowing for acclimation to the laboratory) and had steeper recovery slopes than NA youth. There was also a main effect of emotion regulation on the reactivity slope suggesting that for both groups, as emotion regulation increased, the cortisol reactivity slope decreased. Finally, greater emotion regulation predicted fewer internalizing behavior problems for PI youth but not for NA youth.

AB Past research has reported that college students use alcohol to manage their negative affective experiences. However, this finding is somewhat mixed in mood induction studies, and it is also unclear which students are most vulnerable to drinking for these reasons. The current study examined the roles of child/adolescent trauma exposure with emphasis on early sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties on college students' alcohol-related tension reduction expectancies during a mood induction paradigm. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimentally induced negative or neutral mood condition with questionnaire batteries completed pre-and postinduction. Primary results were based on participants reporting exposure to at least one traumatic event (n = 134). Findings indicated that participants in the negative compared to the neutral mood condition reported heightened tension reduction expectancies; this was particularly salient as exposure to child/adolescent sexual abuse increased. A trend (p = .08) suggested that tension reduction expectancies were higher for participants in the negative mood condition, as reports of sexual abuse and emotion regulation difficulties increased, and after accounting for posttraumatic stress symptoms. Tension reduction expectancies as a risk factor for problem drinking following trauma exposure are discussed, and further, indications that risk for problem drinking following sexual abuse is associated with difficulties managing typical, rather than extreme levels of negative affect are emphasized. Clinical implications include the potential modification of brief alcohol interventions.

AB This longitudinal study sought to investigate associations between adolescent substance use and family functioning and whether internalizing symptoms play a mediating role in this relationship; based on growing evidence from the literature, we also explored gender differences. Participants (N = 1,036) completed surveys in school during 2007, 2008, and 2009. Path analysis results indicated that boys' alcohol use negatively predicted family functioning while marijuana use results indicate both significant impacts on family functioning. Further results show that boys' depressive symptoms mediated the relationships between alcohol use and family cohesion and adaptability. For girls, depressive symptoms negatively predicted family functioning (cohesion, adaptability, communication with mother/father), whereas anxiety symptoms positively predicted this same set of family functioning outcomes with the exception of communication with father.

AB Explanatory theoretical models have proposed an association between problematic online gaming and abilities or strategies in alleviating distress or negative emotions in times of stress as proximal non-gaming-related personality factors. However, there is little research that has targeted how emotion regulation relates to problematic online gaming-especially during adolescence when gaming behavior is most prevalent. In emotion regulation research, there has been a particular emphasis on rumination because it is strongly associated with overall psychopathology. However, it is unknown whether this putatively maladaptive strategy relates to problematic online gaming and whether it is a gender-dependent association. Consequently, the present study examined how emotion regulation strategies, and particularly rumination, related to problem gaming and tested whether gender moderated this relationship in adolescents. In a national representative adolescent sample, 46.9% of the participants (N = 1,646) reported online gaming in the past 12 months and provided information on problematic gaming, and it was these data that were used for further analysis. Their data concerning problematic online gaming and emotion regulation strategies were analyzed, including rumination along with other putatively maladaptive (e.g., catastrophizing) and adaptive (e.g., positive reappraisal) strategies, while controlling for age, gender, and game genre preference. Results of linear regression analyses showed that all the putatively maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (including self-blame, other blame, catastrophizing, and rumination) were positively related to problematic online gaming. Positive reappraisal proved to be a protective factor; it was inversely related to problematic online gaming. In addition, the relationship between rumination and online gaming was moderated by gender (i.e., the relationship was stronger among boys). Based on the results, it is argued that emotion regulation is a useful framework to study problematic online gaming. The present study highlighted that the relative predictive value of rumination for problematic online gaming varied for boys and girls, suggesting that trait rumination might be a gender-specific vulnerability factor for problematic online gaming, but this requires further investigation and replication.

AB Background: Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have co-occurring gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but the etiology is poorly understood. These GI symptoms often coincide with problem behaviors and internalizing symptoms, which reduces the quality of life for these individuals.
   Methods: This study examined the relationships among GI problems, problem behaviors, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 340 children and adolescents with ASD who are patients at the University of Missouri Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders.
   Results: The majority of patients experienced constipation (65%), about half experienced stomachaches or stomach pain (47.9%), and others experienced nausea (23.2%) or diarrhea (29.7%). Young children with aggressive problem behaviors were 11.2% more likely to have co-occurring nausea; whereas, older children showed more complex relationships between internalizing symptoms and GI symptoms. Older children with greater anxiety symptoms were 11% more likely to experience constipation, but 9% less likely to experience stomachaches. Older children with greater withdrawn behavior were 10.9% more likely to experience stomachaches, but 8.7% less likely to experience constipation. Older children with greater somatic complaints were 11.4% more likely to experience nausea and 11.5% more likely to experience stomachaches.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that the presentation of externalizing problem behavior and internalizing symptoms associated with GI problems differs between young children and older children with ASD. Therefore, behavior may have different relationships with GI symptoms at different ages, which may have implications for the treatment of and clinical approach to GI disturbances in ASD.

AB Few studies have examined the effects of parental incarceration (PI) on outcomes above and beyond other risk and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The objectives of this study were to (1) the associations between PI and mental health problems (attention, externalizing, internalizing, and total behavioral problems) and (2) the mediating role of current socioeconomic status and cumulative ACEs. An observational and cross-sectional design was employed. Analyses included hierarchical multivariable linear regression modeling. The analytic sample included 613 adolescents (11-17 years). On average, youth exposed to PI experienced three times as many ACEs compared with youth unexposed. Youth exposed to PI were more likely to have behavioral problems than their unexposed peers. The main effect for all models was attenuated by current economic hardship as well as exposure to increasing numbers of ACEs. Exposure to PI can be viewed as a marker of accumulative risk for intervention since youth impacted by PI are more likely to experience behavioral difficulties and associated adverse childhood experiences. Due to the associated adversity that impact youth exposed to PI, mental health providers need to be able to identify and screen for symptoms associated with trauma.

AB The late positive potential (LPP) has been well documented in predicting the effect of emotion regulation in previous developmental literature. However, few studies have examined age-related changes in emotion regulation from adolescence to adulthood using this biomarker. To test this, Reactivity and Regulation-Image Task was used to test 18 young adolescents and 22 adults to examine the modulation of LPP during emotion regulation. Results revealed that (a) on the behavioral level, adults reported higher intensity of emotional experience than adolescents when they were asked to use up-regulation. Down-regulation showed no age effect for self-reported rating; (b) adolescents showed higher amplitudes of LPP than adults when using different regulatory strategies in all windows; (c) In late time window, regulation effect was larger when using up-regulation strategy than down-regulation strategy for adolescents, while the difference between the two strategies was negligible for adults. (d) In early time window, reactivity effect was larger in negative conditions than in positive conditions for adolescents, while the difference between the two conditions was again negligible for adults. Differences in the amplitudes and time courses of LPP during emotion regulation between adolescents and adults suggested that age-related changes in emotion regulation may occur during adolescence.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the measurement invariance of the Chinese version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA; Gullone and Taffe (Psychological Assessment, 24(2), 409-417, 2011)) across gender. A total of 1388 Chinese adolescents (48.1% males), ranging in age from 11 to 16 years (M = 12.9, SD = 1.09) were recruited from four Chinese middle schools and completed the ERQ-CA. The Cronbach's values, omega coefficients, and item-total correlations for the two subscales of the ERQ-CA indicated adequate internal consistency reliability. The results of confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group confirmatory factor analysis revealed that all configural, metric, scalar, and partial strict invariance models provided acceptable fit to the data. The result of latent means analysis demonstrated statistically non-significant differences between boys and girls. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the ERQ-CA displays appropriate measurement invariance across gender for Chinese youth of ages 11 to 16.

AB The main purpose of the current study was to investigate the predictive role of emotion regulation strategies on depression and psychosomatic symptoms in adolescents. The secondary purpose was to examine the predictive role of some demographic variables on depression and psychosomatic symptoms. The participants for this study comprised 319 high school students [G=155 (48.6%), B=164 (51.4%)], attending three high schools from 9th to 11th grade, and representing different socioeconomic levels in Diyarbakr city center. A Personal Data Form was used to gather data regarding demographic variables. The Turkish version the Children's Depression Inventory, Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire, and Psychosomatic Subscale of Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale were the instruments of the study. Standard regression analysis revealed that academic achievement and grade level were significant predictors of depressive symptoms, while academic achievement and gender variables had predictive power for psychosomatic symptoms. Moreover, hierarchical regression analysis indicated that all emotion regulation strategies played a predictive role in depression, while internal dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and external dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies were significant predictors of psychosomatic symptoms. Taking into consideration that the research findings revealed that emotion regulation strategies played a predictive role on both depression and psychosomatic symptoms, assisting adolescents to develop functional emotion regulation strategies may improve the mental health quality of adolescents.

AB The aim of this paper is to describe a school-based universal intervention (the Tilly's Life Center "I Am Me" program) to promote emotional competence and social-emotional skills in adolescents. We present results of a mixed-methods program evaluation conducted in public schools in Southern California. In Study 1, sixteen students (grades 10-12) participated in focus groups after twelve weeks of intervention. In Study 2, fifty-four students (grades 9-10) participated in either the universal intervention program (I Am Me) or a no-intervention comparison group for thirty-six weeks. We conducted focus groups with 50 adolescents in the I Am Me program and used quantitative methods to measure self-esteem and perceived stress at four time points for both groups in Study 2. Descriptive data suggested improvements in self-esteem and perceived stress among individuals participating in the I Am Me group. Thematic analysis of focus group data indicated that participants perceived improvement in key areas of emotional development, including: emotional competence (understanding, expressing, and regulating emotions), self-regulation, self-esteem, and social skills. Moreover, participants perceived the intervention as relevant and as having a positive lifelong impact on their development. Further research is needed to empirically validate these outcomes using a randomized experimental design.

AB Introduction: There are potential long-term psychosocial effects of experiencing peer victimization during adolescence, including: internalizing symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and risks behaviors such as substance use. While social-emotional theories of development note associations between deficits in emotion competencies and peer victimization in childhood, these associations are less established among adolescent samples. Identifying which inadequacies in emotional competence place particular adolescents at risk for peer victimization may provide insight into the developmental pathways leading to unfavorable outcomes.
   Methods: The current study examined the relation between emotional competence and overt peer victimization among adolescents. Adolescents living in a mid-sized urban city in the southeastern region of the United States (N = 357; Mage = 12.14 years, 92% African American) reported their emotional awareness and reluctance to express emotion at baseline. Two years later, adolescents reported their regulation of anger and caregivers reported on adolescents' global emotion regulation. Adolescents also reported on occurrences of overt peer victimization during the previous 30 days at baseline and during the two-year follow up.
   Results: Our hypothesized model fit the data adequately. Greater emotion awareness was associated with higher scores on caregiver-rated emotion regulation and adolescent-rated anger regulation two years later, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Further, greater expressive reluctance was associated with greater anger regulation, and in turn, lower frequencies of overt victimization by peers. Patterns of associations did not vary by sex or age.
   Conclusions: The present study extends models of social-emotional development and peer interactions into the development age stage of adolescence.

AB Introduction The pervasive use of technology has raised concerns about its association with adolescent mental health, including internalizing symptoms. Existing studies have not always had consistent findings. Longitudinal research with diverse subgroups is needed.
   Methods: This study examines the relationship between screen-based sedentary (SBS) behaviors and internalizing symptoms among 370 Hispanic adolescents living in Miami, Florida- United States, who were followed for 2(1/2 )years and assessed at baseline, 6, 18 and 30 months post-baseline between the years 2010 and 2014. Approximately 48% were girls, and 44% were foreign-born, most of these youth being from Cuba. Mean age at baseline was 13.4 years, while at the last time-point it was 15.9 years.
   Results: Findings show that girls had higher internalizing symptoms and different patterns of screen use compared to boys, including higher phone, email, and text use. SBS behaviors and internalizing symptoms cooccurred at each time-point, and their trajectories were significantly related (r = 0.45, p < .001). Cross-lagged panel analyses found that SBS behaviors were not associated with subsequent internalizing symptoms. Among girls, however, internalizing symptoms were associated with subsequent SBS behaviors during later adolescence, with internalizing symptoms at the 18-month assessment (almost 15 years old) associated with subsequent SBS behaviors at the 30-month assessment (almost 16 years old; beta = 0.20, p < .01).
   Conclusions: Continued research and monitoring of internalizing symptoms and screen use among adolescents is important, especially among girls. This includes assessments that capture quantity, context, and content of screen time.

AB Previous studies suggested adolescents' bullying experiences to be related to risk behaviors, internalizing problems and less perceived social support. Swearer and Hymel (2015) proposed a diathesis-stress model regarding bullying experiences. We expected the diathesis variable adolescent's sex, and the stressors bullying perpetrator or victimization experiences to be related concurrently to risk behaviors, internalizing problems, talking to friends, and perceived peer support. In a cross-cultural trend study, we aimed to test these diathesis-stress relationships across three countries at three measurement times (T1-T3, World-Health-Organization data) to get new insights for future intervention approaches. The samples consisted of n = 3458 adolescents from the United States, Germany, and Greece at T1, n = 3441 adolescents at T2, and n = 4021 adolescents (about 16 years of age) at T3. We conducted latent multi-group structural equation modeling including sex, bullying experiences as perpetrator or victim, risk behaviors, internalizing problems, talking to friends, perceived peer support, and further relevant variables (e.g., school pressure). The results support in part the diathesis-stress model. Girls and boys self-reported similar frequent risk behaviors (smoking, drinking alcohol). Sex related to internalizing problems which were higher in girls than in boys. Bullying perpetration experiences or bullying victimization experiences positively related to internalizing problems across culture and time but not or even negatively with talking to friends and perceived peer support. Talking to friends is difficult for both bullying perpetrators and bullying victims. Easy communication (e.g., talking to friends) should be a central approach in further bullying prevention and intervention programs.

AB While adolescence is a critical stage of development marked by heightened bottom-up emotional reactivity and immature top-down regulatory control, research on emotion regulation has relatively neglected middle childhood to adolescence years. This may be attributed to the limited number and scope of age-appropriate, reliable, and valid measures of emotion regulation. This study examines the confirmatory factor analytic structure and measurement invariance of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), a 10-item self-report measure designed to measure habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, across a 1-year time interval in school samples of adolescents. Results indicate low test-retest reliability but high to acceptable internal consistency over a 1-year time period. The two-factor model has an approximate but close fit to the data collected, which is consistent with underlying theoretical framework and prior empirical findings. Tests of measurement equivalence support strong invariance, indicating that there were no statistically significant differences in factor means, variances, and correlations over a 1-year interval.

AB The current study examined the association between adolescent emotional competence, operationalized and measured at both the individual and the school levels, and gang membership. The study involved a sample of 12,040 students (51.4% females; mean = 16.9 years) participating in the biennial state department of education coordinated California Healthy Kids Survey, which assesses a range of adolescent health-related behaviors. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that higher levels of individual emotional competence were associated with a lower likelihood of identifying as a gang member. Moreover, a stronger negative association between emotional competence and identifying as a gang member was found when emotional competence was operationalized at the school level. Implications include the role of schools in promoting emotional regulation, empathy, and behavioral regulation of their entire student body as part of an overall strategy to reduce individual student's attraction to gangs.

AB The relationship between childhood trauma and dissociative experiences is widely acknowledged. However, the association between emotion regulation difficulties (ERD), anxiety/depression and dissociation in adolescents and young adults with cumulative maltreatment (CM) remains unclear. The present study examined the role of ERD at both intrapersonal and interpersonal levels and anxiety/depression symptoms in the development of psychoform or somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. We assessed 58 participants with CM and 55 participants without childhood trauma history between the age of 12 and 22 years old. Participants completed self-reports of ERD, anxiety/depression, psychoform dissociation and somatoform dissociation. The results revealed that adolescents and young adults exposed to CM displayed high levels of psychoform and somatoform dissociation, ERD and anxiety/depression symptoms. It was also found that intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD predicted psychoform dissociation, whereas anxiety/depression predicted somatoform dissociation in adolescents and young adults with CM. Intrapersonal and interpersonal ERD and anxiety/depression are therapy targets for clinical interventions in adolescents and young adults with CM and dissociative symptoms.

AB Personal resiliency refers to individual attributes that are related to the process of successfully adapting to the environment in the face of adverse conditions, also known as resilience. Emotion regulation is increasingly found as a core component in mental health and found to modulate individual differences in the management of emotional responses. The Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA; Prince-Embury, 2006, 2007) were designed to systematically identify and quantify core personal qualities of resiliency in youth, and includes Sense of Mastery scale (MAS), Sense of Relatedness scale (REL), and Emotional Reactivity (REA) scale. The following study was first conducted to confirm the Three-Factor model of Personal Resiliency in a Norwegian student sample using factor analytic procedures. Secondly and the main purpose of the study, was to investigate if personal resiliency is associated with self-reported measures related to emotion regulation, and with resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation capacity. A revised scale adapted to the Norwegian sample was developed. Results indicate that protective indices related to personal resiliency are associated with both selfreported adaptive emotion regulation and outcome, and partly related to high capacity for emotion regulation indicated by vmHRV. Risk related to personal vulnerability was associated with maladaptive emotion regulation and outcome, but was not associated with emotion regulation capacity. Together the findings provide supporting evidence of both self-reported and psychophysiological correlates between emotion regulatory processes and personal resiliency indicated by RSCA.

AB Background: Cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) have been shown to moderate the influence of War Experiences (WE) on mental health problems. Aims: This study assessed the influence of WE and use of specific CERS on mental health problems among war-affected youth in Northern Uganda. Methods: Five hundred and thirty-nine participants in an ongoing war-affected youth study (WAYS) were assessed by locally developed measures. CERS were measured by Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Multiple regressions were used to assess independent effects of gender, WE, and CERS on mental problems and their potential interaction. Results: Gender, WE and all CERS except positive refocussing and reappraisal had significant independent main effects on symptoms of depression while only WE, self-blame and blaming others had significant main effects on conduct problems. The interaction terms of WE and coping strategies of rumination, catastrophizing, and self-blame significantly predicted symptoms of depression/anxiety while only the interaction between WE and blaming others predicted conduct problems. In contrast, putting into perspective and planning negatively predicted symptoms of depression/anxiety. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce mental health problems should target coping strategies, especially adaptive strategies to youth in many post-conflict settings in Africa.

AB Background: The Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) is an interview that assesses psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, including substance use disorders and anxiety and mood (i.e., internalizing) disorders. Although the SSAGA is widely used, there exists no overall internalizing characteristics scale based on items drawn from SSAGA's mood and anxiety disorder sections. Objectives: To design and assess a SSAGA-based measurement instrument capturing the overall internalizing dimension that underlies more specific internalizing conditions. Methods: We developed, assessed, and characterized a new scale for measuring internalizing problematic characteristics derived from the SSAGA interview. All samples were drawn from the Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism, a prospective multi-site genetic study of families at high risk for alcohol use disorders. All participants taking part in the study between September 2005 and September 2017 were eligible (n = 904, 52.2% female). Results: The scale had adequate internal consistency (ordinal alpha = 0.85, 95% CI = [0.81, 0.89]). Construct validity was supported by its association with other measures of internalizing characteristics (Internalizing Scale from Achenbach Self Reports; Neuroticism Scale from the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Five-Factor Personality Inventory). Several indices of alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine misuse were also positively associated with Internalizing Scale scores. Conclusions: The Internalizing Scale has very good psychometric properties and can be used in studies that incorporate the SSAGA interview to study the association between internalizing characteristics and problematic alcohol and other substance use. These associations can potentially be utilized to identify individuals at risk for substance problems and to design treatments targeting such individuals.

AB Decreased emotional awareness contributes to the risk of internalizing disorders, such as depression. Although emotional awareness may be especially important during adolescence, a developmental period in which emotional arousal is high and the risk of depression rises dramatically, little research has examined the mechanisms linking emotional awareness to depression. Starting from affect regulation models, the current study proposes emotion regulation (ER) as a key underlying mechanism in the emotional awarenessdepression relationship. The current study investigated whether maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies mediate the relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms among youth using a cross-sectional design. Participants were 220 youth (65% girls; Mage=11.87, SD=1.94) who filled out a set of questionnaires assessing emotional awareness, ER strategies, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed no direct relationship between emotional awareness and depressive symptoms. However, emotional awareness yielded a significant mediation effect through total adaptive ER strategies on higher depressive symptoms. No evidence was found for the mediating role of maladaptive ER strategies in this relationship. The current study provides further support for affect regulation models positing that emotional awareness may be a basic skill that is required for learning adaptive ER skills, and thus call for greater attention to adaptive ER strategies.

AB Callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., lack of empathy, lack of guilt, shallow affect) are associated with severe and persistent conduct problems in youth. There is evidence showing a substantial genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems. The etiological associations between CU traits and other psychopathological symptoms, including symptoms of hyperactivity and emotional problems (such as anxiety and depression symptoms), have been less explored. To examine the etiological associations between CU traits and symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity and emotional problems separately through the use of a twin design. Participants were same-sex twin pairs (n=426 twins; 42% female; 43% MZ; age=15) drawn from the Child and Adolescents Twin Study in Sweden, a longitudinal study of twins born in Sweden. The sample was mainly composed of children who screenpositive on neurodevelopmental problems/mental health problems or at-risk children (i.e., screen-negative children considered to be genetically at-risk siblings). We used self-report measures of CU traits, conduct problems, hyperactivity and emotional problems. Model-fitting analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. We found a strong positive genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems and a moderate genetic correlation between CU traits and hyperactivity. We also found a relatively modest, but significant negative genetic correlation between CU traits and emotional problems. Using a sample of adolescent twins screened for neurodevelopmental problems, we replicated previous findings that showed a strong genetic correlation between CU traits and conduct problems and we extended research by examining further the etiological associations between CU traits and symptoms of hyperactivity and emotional problems.

AB Background: Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, many people, including children and adolescents, have fled their homes into neighboring countries. Little research exists on the psychosocial adjustment of refugee children and adolescents resettled in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of PTSD and emotion dysregulation in Syrian refugee children and adolescents who resettled in Lebanon and Jordan. It was hypothesized that a combination of pre-trauma variables (age and gender), trauma-specific variables (traumatic events and time spent in host country, and host country), and post-trauma variables (coping strategies, family relationships, and school environment) would be associated with PTSD and emotion dysregulation.
   Participants and Setting: Participants were 1000 Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 7-18 years attending formal and non-formal schools representing various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan.
   Methods: The trauma exposure scale, DSM-IV criteria for the assessment of PTSD, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Kidcope, Family relationship scales, and school environment scale were administered in an interview format with children and adolescents at school by two trained psychologists. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict PTSD whereas hierarchical multiple regression was used to predict emotion dysregulation.
   Results: Results indicated that 45.6% of the refugees have developed PTSD with excessive risk for comorbidity with emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation was reported by older refugee children and adolescents. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in refugee children and adolescents who had resettled in Lebanon than for those who had resettled in Jordan. Refugee children and adolescents who were exposed to higher levels of war atrocities evidenced the greatest prevalence of PTSD and emotion dysregulation. PTSD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents varied according to coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. Both decreased significantly with the passage of time spent in host country.
   Conclusions: The results may be used to formulate cognitive behavioral coping interventions that can lead to optimal developmental outcomes in the posttrauma environment.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) consists of symptoms of slowness, sluggishness, daydreaming, and low motivation. SCT has been linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing symptoms. and daytime sleepiness. Although there is clear evidence that SCT and ADHD symptoms are distinct constructs, the distinction between SCT, anxiety/depression, and daytime sleepiness is less clear. Prior research has largely relied upon parent-report to evaluate potential overlap between SCT, sleep, and anxiety/depression. despite best practice suggesting that self-report should be used to assess internalizing symptoms. The present study used adolescent self-report to evaluate whether SCT was distinct from daytime sleepiness, anxiety. and depression. Participants were 285 middle school students comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD. Ten confirmatory factor analyses were conducted: four 1-factor models, three 2-factor models, one 3-factor model, one 4-factor model, and a higher order model. Results showed that SCT was indeed distinct from all tested constructs, with the four-factor model including self-report of SCT, anxiety, depression, and daytime sleepiness meeting adequate model fit criteria. All models including SCT as its own factor had improved model fit over models with SCT in a combined factor with another construct. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SCT are discussed.

AB Objective: Trauma exposure is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with youth emotional and behavioral problems. The present study adds to the current literature on trauma exposure and adolescent clinical populations by examining the association between trauma exposure and adolescent self-report of emotional and behavioral problems broadly, including internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in addition to the trauma-specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: This study included 94 female (64%) and male (36%) adolescents, ages 13-19, representing 4 clinical populations: those seeking inpatient psychiatry, outpatient psychiatry, residential substance abuse. and outpatient medical services. Adolescents self-reported trauma history and internalizing, externalizing, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Most adolescents reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event (83%; M = 2.28, SD = 1.83). Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, race/ethnicity, gender, and treatment setting indicated a greater number of types of trauma are associated with externalizing symptoms (beta = .31, p < .01) and PTSD symptoms (beta = .35, p < .01). Conclusion: Trauma is a common experience among adolescents, particularly those presenting for behavioral health services, making trauma-informed care essential in these service delivery settings. Treatment that addresses adolescent risk behaviors and prevents recurrent trauma may be particularly important given the negative impact of multiple traumatic events on developing adolescents.

AB Previous research has established that the ability to manage emotions effectively is critical to healthy psychological and social development in adolescents. However, less research has considered the relationships between specific emotion regulation (ER) strategies, such as reappraisal and suppression, and social wellbeing in this age group. The current study investigated the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between 2 ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) and social outcomes (peer victimization, friendship satisfaction, and family satisfaction) in young adolescents. Analyses also controlled for mental health (anxiety and depression). Given likely gender differences in these variables, key analyses were conducted in parallel for males and females. There were 232 Australian adolescents who completed measures in Grade 7 (Age Mean = 11.97, SD = .35; 64% female) and a year later in Grade 8. Zero-order correlations indicated an inverse relationship between suppression use and social wellbeing variables, although a number of these associations were no longer significant when controlling for mental health. There was limited evidence that reappraisal was uniquely related to social outcomes. However, interaction effects suggested that greater use of reappraisal might have provided some protection against the negative social effects of poorer mental health. Poorer mental and social wellbeing also appeared to be related to ER strategy use, particularly greater suppression use. The findings suggest that ER strategy use, mental health, and social outcomes all play important and interrelated roles in adolescent wellbeing.

AB ObjectivesThe ability to regulate emotions has been linked to a variety of adolescent health-risk behaviors, including sexual risk behaviors, especially for adolescents who are experiencing mental health symptoms. However, there is limited information available on intuitive emotion regulation strategies for early adolescents with mental health symptoms to facilitate the adaptation of emotion regulation interventions for psychopathology to health-risk behavior prevention. For example, interventions to prevent sexual risk behaviors in early adolescence have yet to specifically target emotion regulation.MethodsThis paper describes the use of focus groups to identify emotion regulation strategies that were understood by and acceptable to early adolescents with mental health symptoms who are also more likely to engage in risky health behaviors. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups (k=5 groups) with 15 early adolescents with mental health symptoms.ResultsThe most commonly generated emotion regulation strategies were leaving the situation, distraction, physical release, expressing oneself to someone, positive thinking, and considering other options.ConclusionsEarly adolescents with mental health symptoms identified multiple acceptable and developmentally appropriate emotion regulation strategies. Translation of these findings for use in preventive health-risk behavior interventions (including for sexual risk) is discussed.

AB Objectives
   Since two decades scientific research is studying excessive and dysfunctional new technologies use and its influences on people's lives, in terms of personal, relational, scholastic and work functioning impairment. The objectives of the present study are to investigate gender differences in problematic new technologies use as well as to examine the relationship between problematic new technologies use, emotional regulation and its specific dimensions.
   Methods
   280 italian adolescents (51.1% males) aged 11 to 18 years (mean age = 13.31; SD = 2.33) were recruited from two italian secondary public schools and involved in this study. Data were collected using the Internet Addiction Test, the Video Game Dependency Scale, the Brief Multicultural Version of the Test of Mobile-Phone Dependence and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.
   Results
   Results indicate significant association between emotion dysregulation and problematic internet (r = .504; p < .001), videogame (r = .372; p < .001), mobile-phone (r = .424; p < .001) use. These results support hypothesis that adolescents with greater emotion dysregulation are more likely to experience problematic new technologies use. Additionally, stepwise multiple regression analysis pointed out that the lack of effective emotion regulation strategies is a common risk factors between the problematic new technologies use, but regression analysis highlighted specific risk factors for some of the investigated dependent behaviors.
   Conclusions
   Findings of this study highlight a link between problematic new technologies use, emotion dysregulation and its specific dimensions. The results are discussed considering scientific advances and the role of emotional dysregulation in determining problematic new technologies use in adolescence. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our data.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine a mindfulness model of resilience through the mediating effects of self compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation among underprivileged Turkish adolescents. The sample of the study consisted of 752 students (426 female, 326 male) who aged 14-19 (M = 15.82, SD = 0.88). A path analysis was conducted in order to examine the proposed model. The results showed mindfulness to be a positive and significant predictor of self-compassion while negatively and significantly predicting difficulties in emotion regulation. Furthermore, self-compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation were found to be significant predictors of resilience. Indirect paths from mindfulness to resilience (via self-compassion and via difficulties in emotion regulation) were also significant in the model. The hypothesized model explained 21% of the variance in resilience scores.

AB Research supports cascading relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and academic problems. This constellation of problems is characteristic of early-onset, persistent delinquent [EOPD] youth, and appropriately targeted interventions accounting for this comorbidity may improve outcomes. To investigate these relationships in EOPD youth, we characterized their cross-diagnostic psychopathology and verbal (word-list) learning/memory and evaluated: 1) verbal learning/memory profiles of Withdrawn/Depressed relative to Non-Withdrawn/Depressed youth; 2) cognitive and psychiatric predictors of verbal learning; and 3) emotion regulation as a mediator of psychiatric and cognitive relationships. Results indicated Withdrawn/Depressed youth recalled significantly fewer words during immediate, and some delayed, recall conditions. Less word-learning was predicted by: Withdrawn/Depressed classification, higher trauma-specific re-experiencing symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, weaker executive skills, fewer trauma-avoidance and aggressive symptoms, and earlier alcohol-use onset. Emotion regulation strongly mediated the relationship between verbal learning and psychopathology, but not other cognitive skills, among these youth at high-risk for school dropout. Mental health and education implications are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Biological rhythm theories highlight the reciprocal relations between dysregulated circadian patterns and internalizing psychopathology. Chronotype characterizes individuals' diurnal preference, as some exhibit more morningness or eveningness. Previous research suggests that eveningness prospectively predicts depression in adolescence. Anxiety often co-occurs with depression, but little is known about longitudinal, reciprocal associations between chronotype and anxiety, and whether this relationship remains after controlling for depression. We assessed different forms of anxiety (social, panic, separation), positive/negative affect, anxious arousal (from tripartite theory), and depression, in relation to chronotype to better understand the specificity and directionality of associations between chronotype and internalizing problems in adolescence. Community youth participated in three assessment time points: T1, T2 (18-months post-T1), and T3 (30-months post-T1) as part of a larger longitudinal study. Youth completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and chronotype. Regression analyses showed that eveningness: (1) concurrently associated with decreased separation anxiety, elevated symptoms of depression and low levels of positive affect, (2) was prospectively predicted by elevated depression, (3) did not predict later symptoms of anxiety. The reciprocal, prospective relationship between chronotype and internalizing psychopathology is specific to depression during adolescence.

AB Objective: Early pubertal development is associated with negative health and mental health outcomes. Research on the influence of puberty on mental health underscores a need to examine the interplay between puberty and exposure to environmental risk. This study investigates a more rarely studied aspect of girls' environments romantic relationships with boyfriends. Specifically, this study examined sexual partner age and the timing of girls' pubertal development in relation to externalizing and internalizing symptoms among female students attending therapeutic day schools in the United States, a population at elevated risk for negative mental health outcomes.
   Methods: A total of 121 13 to 19-year-old adolescent girls (Mean age = 15.4; SD = 1.5) reported on the relative age of their past 3 sexual partners, their age of pubertal onset, and mental health challenges via clinical assessments of externalizing and internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Forty-three percent of participants qualified for at least one mental health diagnosis. Earlier pubertal onset predicted greater internalizing symptoms, and this effect did not depend on the age of girls' sexual partners. However, early-developing girls who also reported having a sexual partner more than 2 years older than them were at increased risk for externalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Findings underscore that sexual relationships are an important risk factor for early-developing girls already at risk for mental health problems. Early developing girls with older partners may experience stronger social pressure to stay in relationships that expose them to partner violence and delinquency-related pressure, which combine with interpersonal stress to predict externalizing symptoms.

AB The current investigation examined if changes in youth internalizing problems as a result of a family group cognitive behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for families with a parent with a history of depression had a cascade effect on youth social problems over 24 months and the bidirectional nature of these effects. One hundred eighty families with a parent with a history of major depressive disorder (M age = 41.96; 88.9% mothers) and a youth age 9 to 15 years (49.4% females; M age = 11.46) participated. Findings from a panel model indicated that, compared to a minimum intervention condition, the FGCB intervention significantly reduced youth internalizing problems at 12 months that in turn were associated with lower levels of social problems at 18 months. Similarly, the FGCB intervention reduced internalizing problems at 18 months, which were associated with fewer social problems at 24 months. Changes in social problems were not related to reductions in subsequent internalizing problems. The findings suggest that reductions in youth internalizing problems can lead to lower levels of social problems. Youth social problems are difficult to change; therefore, targeting internalizing problems may be an effective way to reduce the social problems of children of parents with a history of depression.

AB Research has clearly established the important role of parents in preventing substance use among early adolescents. Much of this work has focused on deviance (e.g., antisocial behavior, delinquency, and oppositional behavior) as a central pathway linking parenting behaviors and early adolescent substance use. This study proposed an alternative pathway; using a four-wave longitudinal design, we examined whether nurturant-involved parenting (Fall sixth grade) was inversely associated with adolescent drunkenness, marijuana use, and cigarette use (eighth grade) through social anxiety symptoms (Spring sixth grade) and subsequent decreases in substance refusal efficacy (seventh grade). Nurturant-involved parenting is characterized by warmth, supportiveness, low hostility, and low rejection. Analyses were conducted with a sample of 687 two-parent families. Results indicated that adolescents who were in families where fathers exhibited lower levels of nurturant-involved parenting experienced subsequent increases in social anxiety symptoms and decreased efficacy to refuse substances, which in turn was related to more frequent drunkenness, cigarette use, and marijuana use. Indirect effects are discussed. Findings were not substantiated for mothers' parenting. Adolescent gender did not moderate associations. The results highlight an additional pathway through which parenting influences youth substance use and links social anxiety symptoms to reduced substance refusal efficacy.

AB In the present study, we examined whether profiles of temperamental features in adolescence (a) predict internalizing and externalizing symptoms in early adulthood, and (b) differ in family processes (i.e., cohesion, conflict) during early adolescence. Participants were 662 youth (72% male; 76% White). Mothers reported on family cohesion and conflict during participants' early adolescence (ages 12-14, Time 1). Youth completed measures of temperament in middle adolescence (ages 16, Time 2), and of their symptoms in middle adolescence (Time 2), late adolescence (age 19, Time 3), and early adulthood (age 22, Time 4). Latent profile analysis identified three temperamental profiles: low positive mood, low rhythmicity, and well-regulated. Individuals in the low rhythmicity profile reported higher levels of externalizing symptoms compared to the well-regulated profile. No between-profile differences were found for internalizing symptoms. Mothers of youth in the low positive mood and low rhythmicity profiles reported higher levels of family conflict than the well-regulated profile. In addition, mothers of youth in the low positive mood profile reported lower levels of family cohesion than the well-regulated profile. Research implications of the study findings are presented.

AB The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between adolescent-parent communication and adolescent internalizing problems. Both gender of the adolescent and gender or the parent were considered. An additional goal was to explore whether coping skills mediated this relationship. The sample included a community sample of 980 U.S. high school students. Surveys were administered during three annual assessment waves in seven public high schools during the spring of 2007 (Time 1), 2008 (Time 2), and 2009 (Time 3). Path analysis results indicated significant direct effects only for same-sex adolescent-parent dyads. For boys, adolescent-father communication predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms. Coping did not mediate these relationships. For girls, adolescent-mother communication predicted anxiety symptoms. Further, this relationship was mediated by humor coping. Adolescent-mother communication also predicted depressive symptoms via instrumental social support for girls. These results align with social learning theory and suggest that family-based interventions with same-sex adolescent-parent dyads are warranted to prevent internalizing problems in adolescents.

AB Among the 90% of adolescents involved in juvenile justice who have experienced traumatic victimization, a sub-group may be at highest risk due to histories of multiple types of interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma, termed polyvictims. Latent class analyses (LCA) have identified polyvictimized subgroups in several studies of adolescents and adults, but only one study of traumatic victimization has been conducted with justice-involved youth (Ford et al. 2013). The current investigation replicates and extends that study's findings using LCA to assess a wider range of victimization- and nonvictimization-related adversities and emotion dysregulation, DSM-5 symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and behavioral health problems, such as substance use, anger, depression, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation. In a sample of juvenile detainees three latent classes were identified: mixed adversity (MA; n=327), violent environment (VE; n=337), and polyvictimization (PV; n=145). In contrast to MA youth, PV youth were more likely to report exposure to all forms of adversity, and in contrast to both MA and VE youth, exposure to maltreatment and family violence, and higher levels of emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and depression/anxiety symptoms, somatic complaints, and suicidality. VE youth (vs. MA youth) were more likely to report exposure to violence and non-interpersonal traumas, and were higher on some forms of emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, anger and substance use. Findings suggest that most justice-involved youth have experienced substantial adversity, with almost one in five identified as a polyvictim having experienced multiple adversities, including impaired caregivers, and evidencing the most severe problems in emotion dysregulation and PTSD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms.

AB Anxious youth often have trouble regulating negative affect (NA) and tend to over-rely on parents when faced with challenges. It is unclear how social interactions with parents or peers actually helps or hinders anxious youths' success in regulating NA. The aim of this study was to examine whether the success of anxious youths' emotion regulation strategies differed according to social context. We compared the effectiveness of co-ruminating, co-problem solving and co-distracting with parents/peers for regulating anxious youth's NA in response to stress in their daily lives. We also examined the benefit of attempting each strategy socially vs. non-socially (e.g., co-ruminating vs. ruminating). One-hundred-seventeen youth (9-14) with a current diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and/or Social Phobia completed an ecological momentary assessment (14 calls over 5days), reporting on recent stressors, their affective state, presence of others, and emotion regulation strategies within the prior hour. Mixed linear models revealed that co-distracting was the most effective social strategy for reducing NA, but only for boys. Co-rumination was the least effective social strategy for regulating NA. Regarding social context, only co-distracting was more effective for regulating NA over distracting alone, but only among anxious boys. Results suggest that co-rumination is an ineffective use of social support for regulating NA. Anxious boys may benefit from social support by co-distracting with parents/peers, but improper use may reflect avoidance and contribute to long-term anxiety maintenance. Results extend research on gender differences in interpersonal relationships and emotion regulation.

AB A conceptual model was tested, separately for male and female adolescents, in which adolescent dating violence (ADV) perpetration toward a romantic partner is affected by the memories of authoritarian paternal and maternal parenting styles through the mediation of adolescents' emotion dysregulation. The sample consisted of 622 Italian adolescents (35.5% males; 64.5% females) aged 13 to 21 years. Participants completed a questionnaire composed of three self-report scales: Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire measuring adolescents' memories of parenting styles; Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory, measuring multiple forms of abusive behavior that may occur between adolescent dating partners; and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire, measuring emotion regulation. For both male and female adolescents, there were significant indirect effects of the memories of both maternal and paternal authoritarian styles on ADV perpetration that were mediated by the adolescents' impulse control difficulties.

AB The present study examined the various configurations of Chinese fathers' emotion socialization behaviors and how these configurations relate to adolescents' emotion regulation (ER). A total of 731 Chinese secondary school students completed measures of paternal reactions to their negative emotions, their use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression strategies, and overall ER ability. Four profiles of paternal emotion socialization were identified: the supportive (high supportive, low punitive, and moderate minimization responses to adolescents' negative emotions), the balanced (moderate warmth/responsiveness and nonsupportive reactions, and below-average levels of expressive encouragement), the disengaged (low across the four paternal emotion socialization practices), and the harsh (low supportive and high nonsupportive responses) profiles. Chinese adolescents with supportive and balanced fathers reported greater use of cognitive reappraisal than did those with disengaged and harsh fathers. Overall ER ability was the highest among adolescents with supportive fathers and the lowest among those with harsh fathers. Expressive suppression did not differ across four profiles. These findings highlight the importance of adopting person-centered approaches in understanding parental emotion socialization strategies and their associations with adolescents' emotion regulation.

AB Based on the evidence that emotion regulation difficulties underpin many mental health struggles during adolescence, including substance use disorders (SUDs), we focused on distress tolerance as a particularly salient mechanism of action for bolstering emotion regulation outcomes for adolescents in early SUD recovery. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in improving distress tolerance through teaching skills to reduce individuals' perceived stress or feelings of crisis and increasing a sense of agency and self-regulatory efficacy. The aim of the present study was to improve emotion regulation outcomes in the student body of a recovery high school (N = 27) through six weeks of mindfulness intervention content delivered in a small-group format. Thus, we tested feasibility through recruitment and retention rates and examined preliminary efficacy outcomes from two, randomized mindfulness intervention conditions, and used a comparison group of students without an SUD diagnosis (N = 29) sampled from the community. Results indicate significant post-intervention impacts on recovery students' depression symptomology and on two separate measures of impulsivity (t(22) = 2.358, p < .05; t(20) = 2.358, p < .05; t(17) = 3.979, p < .01, respectively), although no significant differences between intervention condition were noted. Findings from the current study echo similar studies with comparable samples. Implications for the dosage and approach of group-format mindfulness interventions for adolescent samples are discussed.

AB Background/Aim. Attachment and emotion regulation skills are recognized as important factors in the development of depression, but their specifics have rarely been discussed in clinical adolescent population. The aim of our study was to investigate attachment and emotion regulation strategies in adolescents with depression. Methods. The sample consisted of 101 adolescents, age 16 to 24, divided into three groups: 1) 41 adolescents with the diagnosis of depressive disorder; 2) 30 adolescents with the diagnosis of anxiety disorder; 3) 30 health adolescents (without psychiatric diagnosis). The assessment was done by the following instruments: the Socio-demographic questionnaire; the Semistructured clinical interview (SCID-I) for the Diagnostic and Stratistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) and Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Data were analyzed using MANCOVA and partial correlation, with gender, age and birth order as covariates. Results. The adolescents with depressive disorders had less secure attachment to mother and peers than the health adolescents and less secure attachment to father comparing to other two groups (MANCOVA F = 4.571; p = 0.000). The adolescents with anxiety disorder had less secure attachment to father and peers compared to the healthy adolescents group (p < 0.05). The depressed adolescents used the strategy of cognitive reappraisal less often than both control groups (MANCOVA F = 5.200; p = 0.001). Subjective experience of depressive symptoms was related to insecure attachments to both parents and peers (r = -0.457; -0.436; -0.349; p = 0.000), as well as to lower use of cognitive reappraisal (r = -0.446; p = 0.000). Conclusion. Our findings related the adolescent depression to insecure attachment in all domains, with the specific weakness in emotion regulation (weak cognitive reappraisal). The findings could have practical implications for preventive and therapeutic interventions.

AB BACKGROUND
   Diagnosis of chronic illness, which constitutes a life-threatening situation such as in Marfan syndrome or disease with periods of remission and severity such as in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), leads to problems with the functioning of the adolescent and the whole family system. Therefore the aim of the study was to determine the differences in severity of internalizing and externalizing problems and in the perception of the family system between adolescents with Marfan syndrome, with JIA, and without chronic disease, as well as to determine whether characteristics of the family system are associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors in those groups.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The study involved three groups of adolescents: 1) with Marfan syndrome (n = 25), 2) with JIA (n = 29), and 3) without chronic illness (n = 20). We used the adolescent version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Family Assessment Scale.
   RESULTS
   Our results indicated that adolescents with Marfan syndrome have similar scores compared to adolescents with-out illness on all subscales concerning both internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as the family system's characteristics. Compared to adolescents with JIA, adolescents with Marfan syndrome had lower scores on externalization symptoms and Attention Problems and they also perceive their families as less balanced. Additionally, in the perception of adolescents with Marfan syndrome and with JIA the weaker the family bond, the stronger the intensity of externalizing behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Although in the light of our novel research, adolescents with Marfan syndrome do not present behavioral problems different from healthy peers, it is worth continuing such research in order to verify the results. Adolescents with JIA present more externalizing behaviors than peers without chronic illness, which is consistent with some previous research. Research on families of an adolescent child with Marfan and JIA are quite novel and they should be continued.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the link between peer victimization and substance use and tested the mediating role of internalizing problems in urban African American adolescents in Chicago. Six hundred and thirty-eight adolescents in Chicago's Southside participated in the study. Results from the hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that youth who reported peer victimization were at risk of internalizing problems. Those who were bullied by their peers were more likely to display internalizing problems, which was also significantly associated with substance use. Consistent with the self-medication hypothesis, findings from the study suggest that bullied youth are likely to display internalizing problems and turn to substance use. Implications for mental health practice in school settings are also discussed.

AB This study investigates the usefulness of the emotion regulation (ER) brain behavioural systems and sensory sensitivity to better understand sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Specifically, associations between positive and negative ER, and incremental validity of brain behavioural systems and highly sensitive person (HSP) as predictors of the attitudes towards appearance are examined. Data were obtained in a sample of healthy adolescents (N = 331). Results of a series of multiple regression analyses showed that ER provided a significant prediction of each of the five attitudes towards appearance variables. Dimensions of brain behavioural systems including behavioural activation system (BAS), behavioural inhibition system (BIS), fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) showed multiple associations with facets from the attitudes towards appearance. BAS and FFFS were found to be the positive predictors and BIS was a negative predictor. HSP was found to be a positive predictor of attitudes towards appearance. The results expand the understanding of the attitudes towards appearance and indicate how domains of ER, personality, and sensory processing could explain the attitude of adolescents towards their appearance.

AB Background: Findings show that deficiencies in the ability to understand mental states are related to many forms of psychopathology. Mentalizing dysfunctions are suggested to be the core pathology underlying borderline personality disorder (BPD). Moreover, research suggests that BPD predicts psychopathology in general and findings display that diminished mentalization is related to a range of psychiatric disorders. As yet, no study has investigated the potential link between borderline personality features, mentalization and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and whether internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in BPD might be driven by impaired mentalization.
   Objective: In a cross-sectional study, 109 patients referred to a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic were assessed with a battery of self-report instruments to asses borderline personality features, mentalization, and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.
   Method: Simple mediation model was used to examine whether mentalizing abilities mediated the relationship between borderline features and psychopathology in regard to externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents.
   Results: The results indicated that mentalization mediated the relationship between borderline personality features and both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents, indicating that mentalization underlie externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents with borderline personality features.
   Conclusion: The current study is the first empirical study to evaluate mentalization as a mediating factor between adolescents who met full or sub-threshold criteria for BPD and psychopathology. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between parent-child relationship and emotional regulation in adolescents across four countries regarding: (a) mother-child relationship; (b) father-child relationship; (c) adolescents' emotion regulation; and (d) the relationship between mother-child/father-child close relationships and adolescents' emotion regulation. Sex differences were also considered in the analysis. The sample of 270 Zambian, 216 Argentinian, 200 Ghanaian, and 180 Indian adolescents answered The Experience in Close Relationship Questionnaire and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire. Results revealed cultural differences in the way adolescents perceived their relations with parents. Zambian adolescents were more likely to perceive their relationship as avoidant compared to Ghanaian, Argentina and Indian. Consistent with literature, Zambian and Argentinian adolescents who perceived their parents as avoidant were likely to use less cognitive appraisal as an emotion regulation strategy. Finally, Argentinian adolescents who used expressive suppression were also likely to perceive their parents as avoidant.

AB There is general agreement in the research literature that youth in juvenile justice facilities are more likely to experience mental health disorders than their general population peers. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the methodological characteristics and effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered in juvenile justice settings on symptoms associated with internalizing disorders. The 11 studies included in the current review incorporated pretest-posttest research designs and were conducted with juveniles in secure facilities that reported outcome measures of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, or internalizing disorders. Meta-analytic findings indicate mixed results for interventions affecting internalizing symptoms and varying results between studies implementing an experimental design compared to those using a single group non-experimental design. Additionally, no studies examined how interventions could be incorporated into daily activities in juvenile justice facilities, such as school and classroom activities. Lastly, the limited number of studies included in the current review indicates a continued need for further experimental research on the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered to youth in juvenile justice facilities.

AB Aim. This study explores the association between sleep quality and emotional regulation, and investigates the genetic and environmental bases of this association.
   Methods. Three-hundred-eighty-two adolescent twins, from the Italian Twin Registry, and their parents filled the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist questionnaires, from which the construct of Effortful Control (EC) was derived as a measure of emotional regulation. Twins were identified as "good" or "non-good" sleepers based on answers to the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire. EC levels were compared between samesex sleep discordant twins.
   Results. A significant association was detected between EC scores and sleep quality. When controlling for shared (fetal or early life) environmental factors and genetic background in the discordant twin analysis, this association weakened in dizygotic twins and disappeared in monozygotic twins.
   Conclusion. Results support the association between sleep quality and EC in adolescence; furthermore, they suggest that sleep quality and emotional regulation may depend on common genetic or environmental factors.

AB This randomized controlled trial examined the longitudinal effects of two school-based indicated depression prevention programs on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as measured by adolescents, their parents, and their teachers. One hundred eighty-six adolescents participated in this study. The average age was 14.01 (SD = 1.22) years, and the sample was 66.7% female. One third of the sample belonged to a racial minority. Youth received either Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training or group counseling. Symptoms were assessed using adolescent, parent, and teacher reports on the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment at baseline, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. Adolescents reported the most robust effects in favor of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training. Adolescents in Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training reported significantly greater reductions in internalizing symptoms through the 6-month follow-up and significantly greater reductions in externalizing symptoms during the intervention as compared to group counseling. Less robust effects were found when examining parent and teacher reports, although there was evidence of significant within-group change in parent-and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms for both interventions and significant between-group differences in teacher-reported externalizing symptoms. This study provides additional evidence supporting the efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training as a depression prevention program for adolescents. Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training appears to have fast-acting effects on broadband internalizing and externalizing symptoms as reported by adolescents. This suggests that Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training may serve as a transdiagnostic preventive intervention. Moreover, given the disparate reports of adolescents, parents, and teachers, this study demonstrates the significance of collecting information from multiple sources when possible.

AB Our aim was to investigate whether four treatment features (i.e., the inclusion of parental involvement, goal-setting strategies, maintenance/relapse prevention sessions, the addition of booster sessions) were associated with posttreatment and follow-up effect size of youth cognitive behavioral therapies (yCBTs) for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in age groups spanning young children to adolescents. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of 106 yCBTs tested in 76 randomized clinical trials from the PracticeWise Database to examine average effects of yCBTs posttreatment and at a later follow-up assessment. We coded the use of parental involvement, goal setting, booster sessions, and maintenance/relapse prevention in each yCBT and conducted random-effects meta-regression analyses to investigate whether these treatment features were associated with yCBT effects at posttreatment as well as at follow-up. Overall, yCBTs produced large pre- to posttreatment effects (d = 1.05), 95% confidence interval [0.94, 1.15], and larger pre-to follow-up effects (d = 1.29), 95% confidence interval [1.18, 1.40]. Metaregression results indicated that parental involvement was significantly associated with larger pre- to posttreatment effect sizes as well as pre-to follow-up effect sizes. Booster sessions, goal setting, and maintenance/relapse prevention were not significantly related to effect sizes at posttreatment or follow-up. Parental involvement may be helpful for maximizing long-term effectiveness of yCBT. Future studies should investigate for whom and under what conditions inclusion of yCBT treatment features is related to the durability of treatment gains.

AB Self-esteem is a potent indicator of mental health in typically developing (TYP) individuals. It is surprising that there have been few comprehensive investigations of self-esteem in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), given that they are at high risk for comorbid mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. The objectives of the current study were to assess how youth with ASD rate their self-esteem compared to age-matched TYP youth and to examine how self-esteem relates to internalizing psychopathology and theory of mind in the two groups. Seventy-three children and adolescents, ages 9 to 17, were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing self-esteem and internalizing symptoms, as well as tasks designed to measure theory of mind. Results indicated that youth with ASD rated their self-esteem significantly lower than did TYP youth. Self-esteem was strongly related to depression in both groups but was negatively related to theory of mind only for youth with ASD. These results may provide important insights into how individuals with ASD form evaluations of their own self-worth and illustrate how increasing self-awareness in individuals with ASD is not without risks.

AB This study explores the prevalence of bullying and victimization among Cypriot adolescents diagnosed with mental health problems. Their psychosocial adjustment in relation to bullying is studied. The sample consisted of 187 adolescents (60.2% boys; M age = 13.2) and their parents. The present sample reported significantly higher rates of victimization than existing published normative values chi(2) (1, N = 187) = 27.0, p < .001. An alarming finding was that a total of 25.8% reported to be involved in bullying. There was a significant positive correlation between bullying and emotional symptoms (r = 0.36, p < .001), conduct problems (r = 0.35, p < .001), hyperactivity (r = 0.23, p < .003) and peer problems (r = 0.48, p < .001). The study suggests that there is increased victimization and psychosocial difficulties among Cypriot clinical population in regards to bullying.

AB The widespread use of virtual social networks (VSN) by adolescents makes it possible to conduct psychological assessments or health promotion using these platforms. However, psychometric properties of them should be validated. This study aimed to test the feasibility of administering the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) over a secure social network, while preserving its original psychometric properties. To do so, a sample of 703 adolescents (M= 13.86 years, SD= 0.49) completed the questionnaire either over a social network or using paper and pencil. We tested a two-way format equivalence: quantitative equivalence (comparing score distributions across versions); and qualitative or conceptual equivalence (comparing the between-factor correlations between versions and measurement invariance). As a result, no difference was found between the score distributions of the two versions and between-factor intercorrelations with similar patterns in both versions. Finally, both methods for administering the RCADS showed an adequate fit with their theoretical latent structure, thus preserving format equivalence. To sum up, VSN may, therefore, constitute appropriate contexts for conducting psychological assessment and research among adolescents.

AB Background: Emotional intelligence refers to how individuals deal with intrapersonal or interpersonal emotional information and how a subject identifies, expresses, understands, regulates, and uses his/her own emotions or those of others. The purpose of the present study was to validate the Arabic version of the "Profile of Emotional Competence" (PEC) questionnaire.
   Methods: A sample of 285 Tunisian participants (153 men and 132 women) was recruited, age range: 12-18 years (15.2 +/- 2.4 years). The participants were prospectively classified into the following two groups: athletes (n= 101) and nonathletes (n = 184).
   Results: Findings of the present study indicated that the Arabic version of the PEC questionnaire has good psychometric properties. The Cronbach's a suggested that all subscales had adequate internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was excellent. The correlations between interpersonal and intrapersonal subscales were low to moderate (from 0.37 to 0.59), except for the regulation interpersonal, utilization interpersonal, and utilization intrapersonal subscales, which showed negligible correlations with the other subscales. The two-factor solution (interpersonal and intrapersonal competence models) accounted for 62.1% of variance. All subscales loaded on the expected factor, except for the utilization intrapersonal and regulation interpersonal subscales, which did not yield a satisfactory loading. Age and athletes' status impacted on all the PEC dimensions, except for some subscales.
   Conclusion: Finally, psychologists and practitioners in the Arab world could use the PEC questionnaire as a valid and reliable instrument for planning ad hoc interventions.

AB The present study sought to know emotional aspects of children with hearing difficulties and to check their influence on language development from the perspective of the children themselves, their parents and their teachers of Gran Canaria and Tenerife islands. We analyzed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) administered to 300 children who used cochlear implants or hearing aids compared to the perceptions of their families and teachers in the same questionnaire. In addition, a regression analysis was applied to know if the results in the SDQ influence those obtained by the children in the Illinois Psycholinguistic Aptitude Test (ITPA). The findings showed that the assessment of the emotional dimensions of the children in terms of strengths and weaknesses were judged differently in the three groups of informants studied, the scale being the most difficult emotional issue. Both evaluative instruments were correlated and a linear regression analysis that the score linked to the measurement of the emotional aspects predicts the results in the different dimensions of ITPA. The findings of this study are relevant for the design of educational programs in the field of communication and language of children.

AB This study aimed to examine the concurrent relation between six dimensions of emotion dysregulation, proposed by Gratz and Roemer (2004), and suicide ideation and attempt in a large sample of psychiatric adolescent inpatients. A sample of 547 adolescent inpatients completed measures on dimensions of emotion dysregulation, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicidal ideation and attempt. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that limited access to emotion regulation strategies, difficulties in impulse control, and mood disorder diagnosis, were significantly associated with past year suicidal ideation, covarying for other emotion dysregulation subscales, anxiety and externalizing diagnoses, sex, and age. However, difficulties in impulse control was not significantly related to suicide ideation when analyses were conducted separately by sex. Binary logistic regressions also revealed that past year suicidal ideation uniquely and significantly associated with lifetime attempt, covarying for sociodemographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and all emotion dysregulation subscales; these results held when analyses were also conducted separately by sex. Results indicating an association between perceived limited emotion regulation strategies and suicide ideation are consistent with existing research and suicide-focused theory. This finding may have some tentative benefit to informing clinical assessment and treatment of suicidal thoughts. Other findings are discussed.

AB ObjectiveThe purpose of the present study was threefold: first, to analyse the psychometric properties of a 10-item Spanish version of the Purpose in Life Test, which assesses meaning in life (MiL), in a sample of community adolescents; second, to analyse the differences between the age and gender groups; and third, to analyse whether MiL buffers the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness.
   MethodParticipants were 1,599 adolescents from 12 to 19years old, M=15.69, SD=2.14. The Purpose in Life Test-10 Items, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale were used.
   ResultsA nine-item version showed good fit, psychometric properties (internal consistency, construct, and concurrent validity), and factorial invariance across gender and age (12-15years/16-19years). Difference in MiL between boys and girls was not significant, whereas between age groups was significant. MiL had a strong buffering effect on the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness.
   DiscussionIt is desirable to promote the sense of MiL in adolescents. MiL plays a significant and strong mediator role in the relationship between emotional dysregulation and hopelessness, reinforcing the positive role of MiL in mental health and as a resource for facing adversity.

AB The Affective Style Questionnaire assesses the 3 emotion regulation strategies suppression, adjusting/reappraisal, and acceptance and was adapted for adolescents (ASQ-Y) and validated using an adolescent sample (N = 1,092). The results confirmed the expected dimensionality of the English and German versions for adults. An exploratory structural equation modeling procedure (ESEM) yielded model-fit indicators that ranged from acceptable to very good values. The comparative fit index reached an acceptable value of.938, the Tucker-Lewis index yielded an acceptable value of.911. The root mean square error of approximation reached a very good value of.050, and the standardized root mean square residual resulted in a good value of.030. The internal consistencies of the 3 scales reached satisfactory values and were comparable to the English and German versions for adults (suppression: alpha =.77; adjusting/reappraisal: alpha =.76; acceptance: alpha =.76). The 3 subscales showed expected correlations with established instruments in the field of emotion regulation, providing evidence for construct validity. In sum, the ASQ-Y is a suitable and economic instrument for assessing three distinct strategies of emotion regulation in adolescents. The ASQ-Y may be applicable not only in the healthy general population and for prevention purposes but also in clinical settings after appropriate validation studies.

AB This study explores whether the associations between mindfulness and self-compassion skills and emotional eating are mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation in adolescents with overweight/obesity, and whether the direct and indirect effects vary according to nutritional treatment and weight status. The sample included 245 adolescents (12-18 years old) with overweight (85(th)Body Mass Index (BMI)<97(th) percentile) and obesity (BMI97th percentile; WHO 2006) undergoing or not nutritional treatment. Participants completed self-reported measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, difficulties in emotion regulation and emotional eating. Regardless of undergoing or not nutritional treatment and of weight status, difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the associations between mindfulness and emotional eating, and between self-compassion and emotional eating. Specifically, higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion skills were associated with less difficulties in emotion regulation, which, in turn, were associated with less emotional eating (mindfulness: point estimate=-0.14, SE=0.06, 95%CI=-0.26/-0.05; self-compassion: point estimate=-1.76, SE=0.67, 95%CI=-3.20/-0.58). Moreover, whereas mindfulness skills were directly associated with emotional eating, self-compassion was only indirectly associated with emotional eating, suggesting that self-compassion skills are related to emotional eating only because these skills enable more adaptive emotion regulation. Mindfulness and self-compassion may help adolescents with overweight/obesity develop more adaptive responses to emotional distress, which consequently may help them develop healthier eating behaviors. Future research should be developed on the adequacy of mindfulness and compassion-based approaches for adolescents with overweight/obesity.

AB The individual predictors of drinking behaviors among second-generation immigrant adolescents are still understudied. This study investigated emotion regulation strategies and alcohol abuse in 472 adolescents (86 second-generation immigrants and 386 Italian natives; age range: 17-18). The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were used to assess cognitive reappraisal, emotional suppression, and alcohol abuse, respectively. Immigrants reported lower alcohol abuse than natives. A negative relationship between cognitive reappraisal and alcohol abuse was found for immigrants, but not for natives. Specifically, cognitive reappraisal was a protective factor against alcohol abuse only for immigrant adolescents. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB Successful emotion regulation (ER) is a central aspect of psychosocial functioning and mental health and is thought to improve and be refined in adolescence. Past research on ER has mainly focused on one-time measurements of habitual ER. Linking regulatory strategies to emotions in daily lives is key to understanding adolescents' emotional lives. Using an Experience Sampling Method with 78 adolescents (M-age = 13.91, SDage = .95, 66% girls), we investigated the use, selection, and success in down-regulating negative emotions of eight ER strategies across 44 assessments. Acceptance was the strategy employed most often followed by problem-solving, rumination, distraction, avoidance, reappraisal, social support, and suppression. Interestingly, negativity of the event influenced the use of ER strategies: With low intensity negative emotions, acceptance was more likely to be used, and with high intensity negative emotions, suppression, problem-solving, distraction, avoidance, social support, and rumination were more likely to be used. With regard to success, multilevel models revealed that problem-solving, reappraisal, and acceptance were more successful in down-regulating negative emotions than rumination. Further, among girls, no relations between the momentary use of ER strategies and depressive symptoms was found. Among boys, a negative relation between acceptance and depressive symptoms emerged. Results from this study suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between the intensity of negative emotions and ER strategies and that gender differences may exist. Taken together, this study showed which ER strategies are used by a healthy adolescent sample, and these results are discussed with regard to their theoretical and practical importance.

AB A better understanding of emotion regulation (ER) within daily life is a growing focus of research. This study evaluated the average use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and concurrent and lagged relationships between these two ER strategies and affect (positive and negative affect) in the daily lives of adolescents. We also investigated the role of the same strategies at the trait level on these within-person relationships. Thirty-three adolescents provided 1,258 reports of their daily life by using the Experience Sampling Method for one week. Regarding the relative use of ER strategies, cognitive reappraisal (M = 2.87, SD = 1.58) was used more often than expressive suppression (M = 2.42, SD = 1.21). While the use of both strategies was positively correlated when evaluated in daily life (p = .01), the same did not occur at the trait level (p = .37). Multilevel analysis found that ER strategies were concurrently related to affect (p<.01), with the exception of cognitive reappraisal-positive affect relationship (p = .11). However, cognitive reappraisal predicted higher positive affect at the subsequent sampling moment (beta = 0.07, p = .03). The concurrent associations between cognitive reappraisal and negative affect vary as function of the use of this strategy at the trait level (beta = 0.05, p = .02). Our findings highlighted the complex associations between daily ER strategies and affect of a normative sample of adolescents.

AB Objective: Despite a long history of interest in personality traits and psychosis, the association between personality traits and psychotic experiences in the general population is not yet well understood. One possible factor that could influence the degree of distress from psychotic experiences is emotion regulation. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the association between personality and psychotic symptoms is already apparent in non-clinical youth as well as the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies between personality traits and psychotic experiences.
   Methods: Three thousand one hundred and forty seven college students were surveyed via self-report questionnaires measuring the Five-Factor model of personality, emotion regulation strategies, and psychotic experiences.
   Results: Neuroticism was found to be significantly positively correlated with psychotic experiences, while Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were found to be significantly negatively correlated. Both the suppression and reappraisal strategies mediated the relationship between personality traits and psychotic experiences.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that youth with certain personality traits are more likely to have psychotic experiences. The reappraisal emotion regulation strategy could serve as a protective factor against the distress of psychotic experiences.

AB Objective: Exposure to maternal depression during early childhood is a well-documented risk factor for offspring's internalizing problems, but the long-term risk and the psychosocial mechanisms underlying the association remain largely unknown. We examined whether maternal depression during early childhood was associated with offspring internalizing problems in adolescence, and the extent to which negative parenting, peer victimization, and poor friendship quality during middle childhood mediated this association.
   Method: We report on a population-based sample of children (n = 1,443) followed-up from 5 months to 15 years. We use yearly assessments of the exposure variable, that is, maternal depression (5 months to 5 years); the putative mediators, that is, peer victimization, friendship quality, and parenting practices (6-12 years); and assessment of the outcome variables at 15 years: self-reported major depressive (MD), generalized anxiety (GA), and social phobia (SP) symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to test mediation by peer and family relationships.
   Results: Exposure to maternal depression during early childhood was associated with higher levels of adolescent MD, GA, and SP. Peer victimization was the only significant mediator and explained 35.9% of the association with adolescent MD, 22.1% of that with GA, and 22.1% of that with SP.
   Conclusion: Exposure to maternal depression prior to age 5 years was associated with depression, anxiety, and social phobia extending to adolescence via its impact on peer victimization during middle childhood. Particular attention should be paid to victimization as one potential psychosocial factor via which maternal depression is associated with adolescent internalizing problems.

AB Background: In this study, we examined the associations of parents' and adolescents' exposure to community violence (CV) with externalizing and internalizing symptoms among adolescents aged 14-18, and the mediating role of some parental factors in these relationships. The study was based on the secondary trauma perspective in explaining parents' exposure to CV and its implications on their offspring.
   Method. Self-administered questionnaires were filled out by a semi-systematic random sample of 760 Palestinian parent-adolescent dyads from Israel.
   Results: The findings revealed that most of the Palestinian adolescents had witnessed CV, and more than one-third of them directly experienced such violence during their lifetime. Most of the parents had also witnessed such violence, and almost half of them directly experienced such violence during their lifetime. For parents and adolescents, greater exposure to CV was associated with more internalizing and externalizing symptoms among adolescents. Additionally, results of path analysis indicate that parental stress mediated the correlation between the adolescents' direct experience with CV and internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and it mediated the correlation of the parents' direct experience with CV and internalizing and externalizing symptoms among their adolescent offspring.
   Conclusions: The strengths and limitations of the study and their implications for future research are discussed. The implications of the results for prevention and intervention are also discussed.

AB This study explores the levels and psychosocial consequences of social anxiety in adolescents to determine the predictive value of social anxiety in these effects. A total of 2.060 secondary school students (47.9% girls; mean age: 14.34) completed five scales to measure social anxiety, self-esteem, emotion regulation, and peer victimization (off and online). Three groups of youth with social anxiety along a continuum ranging from very low to higher degrees of the disorder were stablished. Differences were found among the groups regarding self-esteem, use of the cognitive reappraisal strategy, and peer and online victimization, with students suffering from higher levels of social anxiety showing the most negative effects. The predictive value of anxiety on these effects ranged from 9% to 33.5%. The results are discussed regarding the impact of social anxiety on well-being versus social discomfort and the need for interventions depending on the degree of this condition.

AB The present investigation examined the underlying role of anxiety sensitivity and its facets in the association between emotion dysregulation and three of the most prevalent and debilitating symptom classes among trauma-exposed psychiatric inpatient youth: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression symptoms. Participants (N= 50; 52.0% female; M-age =15.1 years, SD = .51, range 12-17 years) completed an assessment battery that included measures of emotion dysregulation anxiety sensitivity, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Consistent with hypotheses, the global construct of anxiety sensitivity, as well as its mental incapacitation concerns and disease concerns facets, explained, in part, associations between emotion dysregulation and the three symptom classes. The study results provide novel and clinically meaningful findings regarding the potential mechanistic role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation of emotion dysregulation to PTSD and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. As such, findings underscore the potential value of targeting anxiety sensitivity in general, and mental incapacitation and disease concerns specifically, as a means of reducing risk for internalizing psychopathology among trauma-exposed inpatient youth.

AB The main goal of the current study is to verify the relationships between emotion dysregulation, mentalization, and romantic attachment in late adolescent girls (N=120). Adolescence is a very dynamic and sensitive period, in which many changes occur in attachment and emotion regulation. The role of the primary attachment figures is gradually taken over by peers, and the beginnings of the development of romantic attachment are seen. In summary, this study was able to determine that the level of dysregulation of emotions in girls during late adolescence can be partially explained by mentalization and levels of anxiety (though not of avoidance) regarding a romantic partner, though attachment anxiety is more important for explaining emotion dysregulation than the level of mentalization. Only two aspects of emotion dysregulation show relationships with mentalization: nonacceptance of emotional responses and lack of emotional clarity. Adolescence is considered to be a critical period for interventions to protect against the onset of psychopathology. Confirmation of these relationships appears to be important for the design of therapeutic interventions. Our findings may suggest that attachment patterns, mentalization and emotion dysregulation may be good targets for therapeutic intervention in adolescence.

AB Much like other parts of Asia, late adolescence in India is a particularly stressful time with academic pressures of a highly competitive examination system that determines future occupational success. The present study examined interrelations among reports of parenting, adolescents' regulation of academics-related emotions, school engagement, adolescent socio-emotional functioning and state-exam performance. Four hundred and fifty 10th and 12th graders from suburban high schools in India participated, along with their mothers. At the beginning of the school year, mothers completed measures of parenting, and adolescents completed measures of emotion regulation, school engagement and behaviour problems. At the end of the school year, grades from state exams were obtained from the schools. A multiple mediator model was tested using structural equation modelling. Authoritarian parenting was positively related to adolescent behaviour problems, but not adolescent state-exam performance. Maternal non-supportive responses to adolescent negative emotion were indirectly positively related to adolescent behaviour problems through adolescent emotion dysregulation. Adolescent school engagement mediated the positive relation between maternal supportive responses to adolescent negative emotion and adolescent state-exam performance. These findings underscore the relevance of adolescent emotions for their academic functioning, with implications for the development of interventions for those who struggle during these highly stressful years.

AB Background: The family is the most important institution in identifying the personal coping strategies and emotion regulation skills of the individual.
   Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of emotion regulation and mindfulness modulators in the relationship of parenting stress and parenting styles with coping strategies.
   Methods: The sample was composed of 400 adolescents in 2016 who were selected from different districts of Tehran by multistage cluster sampling. They completed the adolescent coping scale, the Baumrind parenting style questionnaire, an emotion regulation checklist, and a mindfulness assessment tool for children and adolescents. Data were analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: The results showed that mindfulness and emotion regulation are modulators in the relationship between parenting stress and coping strategies (P < 0.0001) and parenting styles and coping strategies (P < 0.0001). There were improper parenting stress and parenting styles but if adolescents developed emotion regulation and mindfulness skills, they would reduce the undesirable effects of bad parenting.
   Conclusions: Emotion regulation and mindfulness skills along with coping strategies in adolescents can modulate the relationship between parenting stress and parenting style.

AB Background and Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is defined as emotion dysregulation. Since such dysregulation is also present during remission, it may be a risk factor for the development of further affective episodes. Therefore, the current study aimed at examining the impact of group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT), in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), on the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of patients with BD.
   Patients and Methods: The current single - blind, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was performed from 2015 TO 2017 at the Psychiatric Clinic of Razi Hospital affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. A total of 70 adolescents with early - onset BD were selected by the convenience sampling method based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders - fourth edition - text revision (DSM-IV-TR) and allocated into receive either12 sessions of GCBT (N=35) or TAU (N = 35). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were evaluated by cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (CERQ) at baseline, after the intervention, and at 3 - month follow - up. Efforts were made to follow up all randomized participants even if they withdrew from the assigned treatment prior to completion of GCBT sessions.
   Results: Compliance with treatment was moderate and the mean number of GCBT sessions that the participants attended was 6.97 (2.81). The 2 groups had significant differences in terms of post - test scores for other - blame (P = 0.001), rumination (P = 0.049), positive refocus (P = 0.008), positive reappraisal (P = 0.005), and putting into perspective (P = 0.001). In the 3-month follow-up, the 2 groups were significantly different only in other - blame (P = 0.001), positive reappraisal (P = 0.001), and putting into perspective subscales (P = 0.001). Therefore, the effects of the intervention were not effectively sustained after 3 months and there was room for improvement in terms of both outcome and compliance.
   Conclusions: The GCBT is more effective when the participants are involved in the studyand get instructions on emotion regulation. However, since the effects of the intervention were not sustained for most of the subscales after 3 months, booster sessions might improve and prolong the impact of psychotherapies.

AB Behavioral systems and emotional regulation are key components of adolescents' emotional development. However, little is known about their role in addiction potential. This research was conducted to evaluate the role of behavioral inhibition systems (BIS), behavioral activation systems (BAS) and difficulty with emotional regulation (DER) in adolescents' addiction potential. The present work is applied correlative research. The 1,900 participants included male adolescents from high schools in the north, south, east, and west of Tehran were the society of this research. The sample was randomly selected by using Morgan's table for as many as 320 students. The entry criteria were gender, age, grade of education, and non-drug abuse. The research measures were behavioral activation and inhibition systems scales, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, as well as the Addiction Prone Personality scale. The results showed the correlations among BIS, BAS, and DER were positively significant (p < .05). The correlation between BIS and addiction potential was significantly negative (p < .05). Finally, BAS, BIS, and DER, respectively, predicted 57%, 20%, and 22% of the addiction potential?s variance. According to the findings, BAS is the best predictor of the addiction potential. It seems that reward responding and seeking pleasure, which were behavioral activation systems subscales, and DER most contributed to predicting addiction potential.

AB Research on cyberbullying has boomed in the past two decades. Findings from studies among adolescents suggest that they can be classified into distinct groups based on their cyberbullying experience, and that cyberbullying seems to be related to poor emotion regulation. So far, only a few studies have examined cyberbullying among adult workers and it is unclear whether cyberbullying develops similarly in that population. Therefore, in this study cyberbullying victimization was assessed in adolescents and adult workers simultaneously to address three aims: (1) to explore which groups can be distinguished based on their cyberbullying experience; (2) to analyze the associations of group membership with the way people regulate their emotions; and (3) to examine whether the results are comparable in adolescents and adults. Latent class analysis was used to analyze data from 1,426 employees and 1,715 adolescents in the first year of secondary education (12-13 years old). In each population, three profiles differing in their patterns of cybervictimization were identified: no cybervictimization (80%), work-related cybervictimization (18%), and pervasive cybervictimization (3%) for adults, and no cybervictimization (68%), similar-to-offline cybervictimization (27%), and pervasive cybervictimization (4%) for adolescents. Furthermore, these profiles differed in their use of emotion regulation strategies, with pervasive cyber-victims suppressing their emotions significantly more than other groups. Future research is needed to clarify the role of emotion regulation in cyberbullying as an antecedent or consequence of victimization.

AB Parental monitoring can reduce adolescents' engagement in risky behaviors; however, adolescents' internalizing symptoms may alter the effectiveness of parental monitoring. The current study examines independent and interactive effects of maternal and paternal monitoring, adolescent's internalizing symptoms, and adolescent gender on sexual behaviors and substance use with data from 659 of the 15-year-olds enrolled in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Results suggest girls who experienced less maternal monitoring and more internalizing symptomsboth independently and interactivelyengaged in more risky sexual behaviors. Greater substance use was associated with less maternal and paternal monitoring for girls and boys, more internalizing symptoms for girls, and interactively with less maternal and paternal monitoring depending on girls' levels of internalizing symptoms. The current study highlights the unique influences of mothers' and fathers' monitoring efforts on adolescent risky behavior based on the adolescent's level of internalizing symptoms.

AB Objective: This study examined nighttime media use in relation to sleep problems and anxiety/depression symptoms in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Participants were 81 adolescents (69% male) ages 13-17 with ADHD. Adolescents completed measures assessing pubertal development, nighttime media use, circadian preference, and daytime sleepiness. Both adolescents and parents completed measures of sleep duration, sleep problems, and internalizing symptoms.
   Results: When summing across media uses (eg, social networking, playing video games, watching television), the average nighttime media use (after 9:00PM) was 5.31 h. Overall, 63% of adolescents reported obtaining less than 8 h of sleep on school nights, and this percentage rose to 77% for parent-reported sleep duration. Moreover, adolescents obtaining less sleep than recommended had more nighttime media use than those obtaining >= 8 h of nightly sleep. Controlling for age, sex, pubertal development, stimulant medication use, and ADHD symptom severity; nighttime media use was associated with shorter sleep duration and increased sleep problems across both adolescent and parent report. Media use was also associated with greater adolescent-reported anxiety and depression, and marginally associated with eveningness circadian preference and greater daytime sleepiness. In considering specific anxiety dimensions, media use was associated with greater adolescent-reported panic symptoms and parent-reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nighttime media use may contribute to sleep problems and co-morbid internalizing symptoms in adolescents with ADHD, although additional studies are needed to determine causality, potential bidirectional associations, and underlying mechanisms such as using media to (mis)manage negative emotions. Media use is important to assess and monitor and may be a significant intervention target when addressing sleep and internalizing problems, and possible underlying cognitive-emotional processes in adolescents with ADHD.

AB We examined how family functioning and emotion regulation strategies relate to both a history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and recovery from NSSI. Participants were 272 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 14.50 years, SD = 1.46 years), of whom 17.6% reported a history of NSSI. As expected, poor family functioning was associated with engagement in NSSI. Among the emotion regulation variables, higher use of self-blame and lower use of refocus on planning was associated with NSSI. Self-blame and refocus on planning also mediated the relationship between family functioning and NSSI. Similarly, better family functioning and adaptive emotion regulation were related to recovery, while maladaptive emotion regulation was negatively related to recovery. Adaptive emotion regulation moderated the relationship between family functioning and NSSI recovery. We discuss how family-based interventions combined with emotion regulation education may help deter NSSI engagement.

AB Despite growing research on the impact of borderline personality pathology (BPP) on treatment outcomes for emotional disorders among adults, no studies have examined this question in adolescents. Moreover, no studies have examined mediators of the relation between BPP and changes in mood and anxiety symptoms during treatment. This study examined the impact of BPP on treatment outcomes in 141 adolescents in psychiatric residential treatment, as well as the mediating role of change in emotion regulation (ie, adaptive responses to emotions) in the relation between baseline BPP and improvements in psychiatric symptoms during treatment. Participants completed questionnaires assessing emotion regulation and depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at baseline and posttreatment. Although BPP was not directly associated with the magnitude of change in psychiatric symptoms from baseline to posttreatment, it was positively associated with greater improvement in emotion regulation during treatment. Furthermore, results revealed significant indirect effects of BPP on improvements in all psychiatric symptoms through improvement in emotion regulation.

AB BackgroundMethodWhole school approaches to mental health are recommended where schools and community partners work together to support positive mental health for young people. Universal interventions which adopt this approach are limited however. This study evaluates the pilot implementation of DBT STEPS-A, a social-emotional learning programme for adolescents, in Ireland.
   Data were collected at the beginning and end of the academic year from students who participated in DBT STEPS-A and a control group. Amatched comparison was conducted where a subset of the data was analysed consisting of 72 adolescents aged 15-16years from two schools in the south of Ireland. Outcomes included emotion symptoms, dysfunctional coping and DBT skill use. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the treatment effect (intervention vs. control).
   ResultsConclusionsA statistically significant treatment effect was observed on two of four outcome measures (emotion symptom index: p=0.011; internalising problems: p=0.012). The effect sizes were large (Cohen's F squared=0.65 and 0.83 respectively).
   Significant reductions on measures which assess constructs including depression, anxiety and social stress were found for the intervention group. The results suggest that DBT STEPS-A may yield positive effects for adolescents who complete the intervention. Feedback from adolescents and teachers suggests that refinement of content, structure and implementation may make the programme more accessible to an adolescent population.

AB Dysregulation of emotions is a risk for social anxiety symptoms, whereas dispositional mindfulness has been proposed as assisting with emotion regulation. The aim of the current study was to examine the unique associations of dysregulation and mindfulness with adolescents' social anxiety, while focusing on the conceptual overlap and the empirical connection between dysregulation and mindfulness. Participants were 336 Australian adolescents (53% girls; 12-15 years) who completed questionnaires. Dysregulation and mindfulness were moderately correlated. Factor analysis revealed two factors accounting for 59% of the variance. The first factor, active dysregulation, had high positive loadings for five dysregulation and high negative loadings for two mindfulness subscales. The second factor, passive regulation, had a high negative loading for one dysregulation and high positive loadings for three mindfulness subscales. Both active and passive composite scores had unique associations with heightened anxiety symptoms. Regression analyses of the original subscales indicated that the dysregulation subscale limited strategies, and the mindfulness subscales observing and describing were uniquely associated with anxiety; strategies and observing were associated with more symptoms, whereas describing was associated with fewer. Interventions that address dysregulation and low capacity for mindfulness may be beneficial for adolescents with heightened social anxiety symptoms.

AB Background: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. When untreated, PKU leads to a significant intellectual deficiency. Although early initiation of dietary therapy allows normal cognitive development, low adherence to treatment may result in neuropsychological deficits, including attention problems. This study was performed to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems in early-treated children and adolescents with PKU using the Child Behavior Checklist - CBCL/6-18 answered by parents.
   Material/Methods: The study included 36 PKU patients. The mean scores of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, syndrome scales, and DSM-IV-oriented scales of patients were compared with those of controls. An analysis to evaluate the importance of adherence to treatment and presence of intellectual disability was also performed.
   Results: There were no significant differences between patients and controls for almost all CBCL/6-18 scales, with the exception of the Attention Problem Scale - CBCL-APS. The mean (+/- SD) of the CBCL-APS scores of patients (7.86+5.33) was considerably higher than the mean of the controls (6.07 +/- 4.37; p=0.016), but not different from the mean of a matched control subsample (6.69 +/- 4.46; p=0.316). The difference between the mean of the scores of DSM-IV/ADHD scale of patients (6.72 +/- 4.07) and controls (5.73 +/- 3.56; p=0.102) was not significant. Non-adherence to treatment and intellectual disability had a negative impact on both CBCL-APS and DSM-IV/ADHD scale scores.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate a significant prevalence of parents' complaints of attention problems and hyperactivity in non-adherent to treatment and intellectually low performing patients with PKU.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is common among adolescents and associated with negative outcomes. However, treatments developed specifically for NSSI and the proposed NSSI disorder (NSSID) are scarce, and access to empirically supported treatments for NSSI in many areas is limited. Online treatments carry the potential to increase the availability of evidence-based treatments. Emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA) has shown promise in the treatment of adolescents with NSSID.
   Method: The present study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of an online version of ERITA. Twenty-five adolescents (aged 13-17) with NSSID and their parents were included in an uncontrolled open trial. Self-report and clinician-rated assessments of outcomes such as NSSI, self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and global functioning were administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3- and 6- month follow-up. Measures of NSSI, self-destructive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were also assessed weekly during treatment.
   Results: Ratings of treatment credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction were acceptable, and the therapeutic alliance and treatment completion rate (96%) were high. Adolescent participation in the treatment was associated with a statistically significant increase in past-month NSSI abstinence (p = .007), large-sized improvements in past-month NSSI frequency (55% reduction, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29, 72; Cohen's d = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.06) and global functioning (d = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.32), and medium-sized improvements in emotion dysregulation (d = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90) and NSSI versatility (d = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.77) from pre- to post-treatment. These improvements were further strengthened at 3-month follow-up and maintained at 6-month follow-up. The online therapist-guided parent program was associated with small-to large-sized (ds = 0.47-1.22) improvements in adaptive parent behaviors, and these improvements were maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, in line with the theoretical model underlying ERITA, change in emotion dysregulation mediated changes in both NSSI frequency and self-destructive behaviors over the course of treatment.
   Conclusions: Together, results suggest that online ERITA is an acceptable, feasible, and promising low-intensity treatment for adolescents with NSSID. The results of this open trial must be replicated in controlled studies.

AB There is a dearth of research evaluating the relationship between obsessive-compulsive (OC) phenomena and emotion regulation (ER) in youth. The current study bridges this gap by utilizing multiple informants to evaluate the relationship between ER processes (e.g., suppression) and OC features in 27 diagnostically-assessed youth. As predicted, after controlling for children's age and distress, obsessive beliefs (e.g., the importance of/need to control thoughts) and OCS dimensions (e.g., washing) possessed negative associations with adaptive skills (ER) and positive relationships with maladaptive processes (emotional lability). Notably, expressive suppression possessed the strongest relationship with obsessive beliefs and OCS domains, and mediated the relationship between these two constructs. Results are discussed in the context of experiential avoidance. Clinical recommendations and future directions are discussed.

AB Music has a positive effect on psychological adjustment and relieve tension and this view has been supported by clinical evidence. However, there is still no in-depth analysis of whether there are differences in the regulating effect of music with different characteristics on human psychology, which leads to the fact that current therapeutic schemes using the music to relieve tension are not targeted. In this context, this paper uses the method of EEG clinical trials to explore the role of differences in music rhythm and music mode in psychological regulation. By monitoring the variance of brainwaves of the subjects and the synchronic characteristics of brainwaves in different regions, the research proves that there are great differences in the psychological regulation effect of music with different characteristics: Compared to fast-rhythm music, the effect of slow-rhythm music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. Compared with major music, the effect of minor music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. The above conclusions can be well applied to the treatment of psychological disorder diseases such as anxiety disorder and depression, providing a reference for the targeted design of music therapeutic schemes.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the moderating role of perceived parental psychological control in the links between shyness and socio-emotional adjustment in Chinese adolescents. Participants were N = 462 Grade 7 and 8 Chinese adolescents (246 boys, Mage = 13.42 years, SD = 8 months) recruited from four randomly selected public schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Participants completed peer assessment measures of shyness and peer victimization, sociometric nominations of peer rejection, and self-report measures of loneliness, depression, and perceived parental psychological control. Among the results, shyness was positively associated with loneliness, depressive symptoms, and peer rejection among adolescents who perceived their parents as higher in psychological control, but no significant associations were found among adolescents who perceived lower levels of parental psychological control. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of parenting practices perpetuating adjustment problems among shy adolescents in urban China.

AB Background: We examined whether increased risk for adolescent tobacco and marijuana problems associated with childhood ADHD is explained by key intermediary influences during adolescence and differs by gender. Methods: Longitudinal structural equation models examined mediating effects on problems with both substances (or each substance separately) through age-14 peer impairment, internalizing, and adolescent ADHD symptoms in two twin samples, prospectively assessed since age 11 (N = 2,164). Whether these mediators contributed beyond mediating effects of early-adolescent substance use was also considered. Twin difference analyses further illuminated which mediators might be potentially causal. Results: Direct effects of childhood ADHD on age-17 tobacco and marijuana problems (i.e., independent of included mediators) as well as effects of adolescent ADHD symptoms were significant only for females. By contrast, mediation by peer impairment, evident particularly for marijuana, was relatively stronger for males than females. Depression and anxiety were not prospectively associated with age-17 substance problems when earlier substance problems were considered. Consistent with causal influence of early substance use on later problems, monozygotic twins with more severe tobacco or marijuana problems at age 14 than their co-twins were also more likely to have substance problems later in adolescence. Conclusions: Mediation through peer impairment, continued presence of ADHD symptoms, and early substance use may alter development so that childhood ADHD indirectly contributes to problems with tobacco and marijuana. Targeting gender-sensitive interventions prior to mid-adolescence, before these patterns become established, is essential.

AB Objective
   Although much empirical attention has been devoted to emotion regulation (ER) in individuals with eating disorders, little is known about ER across a wide age range and among different ED subtypes. The current study sought to examine ER in a sample of eating disorder patients.
   MethodResultsA total of 364 adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa restricting subtype (AN-R), anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype (AN-BP), or bulimia nervosa (BN) were assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
   Older ages were associated with higher DERS total, nonacceptance, goals, and impulsivity scores. When controlling for age, patients with BN and AN-BP had higher overall DERS scores than those with AN, and there were some differences among diagnostic subtypes on specific facets of ER.
   ConclusionsThese results indicate that treatments for emotion dysregulation may be applied across eating disorder diagnoses and ages, and inform how these strategies apply to different diagnostic groups.

AB The present study examined a conceptual model in which the association between aggressive behaviors and suicide ideation is moderated by internalizing symptoms and ongoing stress. Participants were 304 psychiatric inpatient adolescents (65.8% girls) ranging in age from 12 to 17 years (Mean age = 14.69). The association between aggressive behaviors and suicide ideation was significantly moderated by internalizing symptoms and ongoing stress; the association was positive in adolescents low in internalizing symptoms or high in ongoing stress, but negative in adolescents high in internalizing symptoms or low in ongoing stress. The three-way interaction between aggressive behaviors, internalizing symptoms, and ongoing stress was not statistically significant. The current findings indicate that in adolescents who display high levels of aggressive behaviors, the presence of high ongoing stress provides a more useful indicator of levels of suicide ideation than the presence of high internalizing symptoms. Implications for case identification and prevention are discussed.

AB Introduction: The goal of the present study was to identify the prospective relations between weight/shape and muscularity concerns and emotional problems in adolescents.
   Methods: Self-report data of 966 German male and female adolescents were analyzed in a cross lagged panel design.
   Results: Analyses of latent means revealed significant correlations between weight/shape concern and emotional problems as well as between muscularity concern and emotional problems in both genders. Moreover, weight/shape concern predicted emotional problems prospectively, but only in girls. Regarding muscularity concern, we could not find any prospective relation with emotional problems In boys or girls from the general population.
   Conclusions: It is assumed that as appearance is highly relevant for the self-concept in girls, concerns about the look might promote emotional problems. Thus, weight/shape concern should be addressed in the prevention of emotional problems in adolescent girls, whereas further research is necessary investigating the contribution of muscularity concern in this context.

AB Objective The aim of the study was to assess whether the association between chronic family stress and physiological measures is moderated by emotion regulation strategies in an adolescent sample.
   Methods Chronic family stress was assessed via a semistructured interview and emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and suppression) via questionnaire among 261 adolescents (14.57 (1.07) years). Several metabolic (waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and inflammatory markers (basal and stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in response to bacterial challenge) as well as glucocorticoid sensitivity were assessed.
   Results There were no main effects of chronic family stress, cognitive reappraisal, or suppression on physiological measures (all p's > .10). Emotion regulation moderated the association between chronic family stress and physiological measures. As chronic family stress increased, adolescents higher in cognitive reappraisal had smaller waist-hip ratios (B = -.003, SE = .001, p = .015) and lower systolic blood pressure (B = -.303, SE = .143, p = .035), although no moderation was found with respect to inflammatory markers and glucocorticoid sensitivity (all p's > .30). In addition, as chronic family stress increased, adolescents higher in suppression showed evidence of higher stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production (B = .046, SE = .020, p = .021) and lower glucocorticoid sensitivity (B = .051, SE = .021, p = .015), although basal inflammation and metabolic measures were not moderated by suppression (all p's > .50).
   Conclusions This study suggests that the types of emotion regulation strategies used by adolescents may affect the extent to which chronic family stress affects important metabolic and immune processes.

AB Symptoms of anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid and partially share a genetic etiology. Mean levels of anxiety and depression increase over the transition to adolescence, particularly in girls, suggesting a possible role of pubertal development in the activation of underlying genetic risks. The current study examined how genetic and environmental influences on anxiety and depression differed by chronological age and pubertal status. We analyzed composite scores from child self-reports and parent informant-reports of internalizing symptomology in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1,913 individual twins from 1,006 pairs (ages 8-20 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Biometric models tested age and pubertal status as moderators of genetic and environmental influences shared between and specific to anxiety and depression to determine whether etiology of internalizing symptomology differs across development as a function of age or puberty. Genetic influences did not increase as a function of age or puberty, but instead shared environmental effects decreased with age. In an exploratory model that considered the moderators simultaneously, developmental differences in etiology were reflected in genetic and environmental effects unique to depression. Results suggest that genetic variance in internalizing problems is relatively constant during adolescence, with environmental influences more varied across development.

AB Objective Executive functioning deficits have been documented among congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors and may contribute to emotional distress. Little research has investigated the role of coping in this association. This study examined the role of coping in accounting for the association between self-reported executive function problems and internalizing symptoms among adolescents and emerging adults (AEAs), as well as young adults (YAs) with CHD. Methods Participants included 74 AEA (M-age = 19.32 +/- 3.47 years, range 15-25 years) and 98 YA CHD survivors (M-age = 32.00 +/- 3.69 years, range 26-39 years), recruited from pediatric and adult outpatient cardiology clinics. Participants completed self-report measures of executive function problems, coping (primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping), and internalizing symptoms. Lesion severity classification and functional impairment due to symptoms of heart failure were determined from medical chart review. Results Significant problems in executive function were reported by 5% of AEA and 13% of YA. Coping was not associated with executive function problems or internalizing symptoms for AEA. However, among YA, less use of adaptive coping strategies and more maladaptive coping responses was associated with both more executive function problems and internalizing symptoms. An indirect effect of executive function problems on internalizing symptoms via secondary control coping emerged for YA. Conclusions Executive function problems may disrupt the ability to use important adaptive coping skills, such as cognitive reappraisal, positive thinking, and acceptance, thereby resulting in greater emotional distress among YA CHD survivors.

Most studies measure conventional (household) ACE exposures without accounting for non-conventional (community) ACE exposures, which may underrepresent the adversity experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. We address this gap by calculating the prevalence of both types of ACE exposures for racial/ethnic subgroups. We also examine associations of ACE exposures and emotional regulation in school aged children and youth.
   Design and Methods: This study used data (n = 65,680) for a nationally representative sample of children ages 6 to 17 years in the National Survey of Children's Health (2011-2012). Confirmatory factor analysis, descriptive statistics and regression models were used to examine the relationships between ACEs and emotional regulation.
   Results: Community level ACE events disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Some but not all ACEs were significantly and inversely associated with the ability to emotionally regulate in children. Experiencing racism had the strongest negative effect of all ACE variables. The strength of the child-caregiver relationship was associated with increased odds of emotional regulation, independent of exposure to ACEs.
   Conclusions: The study supports the need to refine and expand ACE health screenings to fully capture the adversity faced by all children. Emotional regulation is identified as a possible intervention point.
   Practice Implications: Expansion of programs that strengthen the child-caregiver relationship and reduce ACEs in early childhood may be a key approach to increasing coping abilities in youth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have reported contrasting results in the socio-emotional adjustment of Italian adolescents with cochlear implants (CIs). The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between the socio-emotional adjustment of adolescents with CIs, the quality of their hospital stay, and their age at CI activation. The participants were 29 adolescents with CIs (CI group) and 29 typically developing adolescents (TD group). The Emotional Autonomy Scale, the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents, and the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale were administered to each participant. The emotional experience reported during the hospital stay was considered for each participant in the CI group. The adolescents with CIs displayed significantly higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of aversion toward aloneness than the TD group participants. Adolescents who had received the CI in preschool displayed a higher level of physical self-concept than adolescents who had received it later. The adolescents' emotional experiences at the hospital were reported to be quite complex and related to their relationships with parents. In summary, the findings point to a specific type of fragility in socio-emotional adjustmentfocused on loneliness/alonenessrather than a general one.

AB To assess prevalence and severity of emotional dysregulation (ED) in psychiatrically referred youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD youth (N = 123) were compared to youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. The majority of psychiatrically referred youth with ASD had positive Child Behavior Checklist-ED (CBCL-ED) profile that was significantly higher than in youth with ADHD (82 vs. 53%; p < 0.001). The severe emotional dysregulation (SED) profile was significantly greater in ASD youth than ADHD (44 vs. 15%; p < 0.001). In the presence of SED profile ASD youth suffered from greater severity of autism, associated psychopathology, and psychosocial dysfunction. Greater than expected prevalence of SED in psychiatrically referred youth with ASD that identifies distinct clinical correlates associated with severe morbidity and dysfunction.

AB Background: It is known that children with disabilities, especially adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are at increased risk for victimization. However, little is known about the impact of victimization over time.
   Aims: Primary aims included identifying to what extent risk factors (Le., internalizing behavior problems and conflict in friendship) related to bullying victimization over time.
   Methods and procedures: In-depth interviews conducted separately with 15-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), or typical development (TD) and their mothers investigated the experiences of victimization in a two-year follow up to an earlier study at adolescent age 13.
   Outcomes and results: Findings at age 15 demonstrated that the highest rates of bullying continued to be endorsed by youth with ASD. However, youth with ID were found to experience and report the most severe bullying. Longitudinal examination revealed that internalizing behaviors at age 13 predicted victimization experiences at age 15.
   Conclusions and implications: During middle adolescence, youth with ASD continue to experience more frequent victimization. Thus, shifting the focus of interventions that not only target the salient social deficits of ASD, but also address comorbid conditions such as internalizing symptoms, may further contribute to reduction of social isolation and peer difficulties.

AB Anxiety and depression are often comorbid with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There is empirical support to suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for comorbid anxiety disorders in youth with ASD. Modifications to CBT for youths with ASD have been made with emphasis on exposure being a critical component. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of CBT on symptoms of depression in youths with ASD. Modifications to CBT will be outlined in this review, as will implementation suggestions for the clinician practicing CBT with ASD youth. Limitations of the studies investigating this intervention include small sample sizes, clinician- and parent-report of symptom change but not consistent self-identified change, limited validated tools for assessing change, and lack of long-term follow-up.

AB Parental bonding and emotional regulation, while important to explain difficulties that may arise in child development, have mainly been studied at an individual level. The present study aims to examine alexithymia and parental bonding in families of adolescents with psychiatric disorders through different generations. The sample included a total of 102 adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders and their parents. In order to take a family level approach, a Latent Class Analysis was used to identify the latent relationships among alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), perceived parental bonding (Parental Bonding Instrument) and the presence of adolescent internalizing or externalizing psychiatric symptoms (Youth Self-Report). Families of internalizing and externalizing adolescents present different and specific patterns of emotional regulation and parenting. High levels of adolescent alexithymia, along with a neglectful parenting style perceived by the adolescent and the father as well, characterized the families of patients with internalizing symptoms. On the other hand, in the families with externalizing adolescents, it was mainly the mother to remember an affectionless control parental style. These results suggest the existence of an intergenerational transmission of specific parental bonding, which may influence the emotional regulation and therefore the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between parental psychological control (PPC) as perceived by adolescents, emotion inhibition, emotion regulation, and depression in adolescents using a structural equation model. The participants were 316 middle school students in metropolitan areas of South Korea who completed the Domain-Specific Assessment of Psychological Control (DAPC), Children's Sadness Management Scale (CSMS) and Children's Anger Management Scale (CAMS), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, structural model verification, and bootstrap analysis. The results of this study indicated that PPC had a direct effect on depression. In addition, PPC had a significant effect on the emotion inhibition of dysfunctional emotion regulation, and emotion inhibition significantly affected depression. Therefore, emotion inhibition had a mediating effect between PPC and depression. Finally, this study's implications and limitations are presented.

AB Scientific research on leisure has proven its contribution to physical and psychological well-being in adolescents, especially regarding the practice of structured leisure activities. Leisure is considered a privileged context for adolescents to develop and learn several developmental skills, such as emotion regulation (ER). Nevertheless, the relationship between leisure and ER has been under-researched in adolescents. The present cross-sectional study aims to test a conceptual model concerning the relationship of leisure attitudes and leisure satisfaction with adolescents' positive functioning and to explore the role of emotion self-regulation strategies in that relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that leisure attitudes would be a predictor of leisure satisfaction; leisure satisfaction would be a predictor of positive functioning dimensions (self-esteem; satisfaction with life; psychological well-being); and the relationship between leisure satisfaction and positive functioning dimensions would be mediated by emotion self-regulation strategies [cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES)]. The participants in this study were 654 adolescents from 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, aged between 14 and 19 years old. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. The structural equation analysis showed that leisure attitudes are a significant predictor of leisure satisfaction, and that leisure satisfaction significantly predicts all positive functioning dimensions. CR mediated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and self-esteem. These findings highlight the importance of developing positive attitudes toward leisure to increase adolescents' levels of leisure satisfaction. This study also supports the importance of leisure satisfaction for achieving adolescents' positive functioning. Future studies should continue to examine the role of emotion self-regulation strategies on leisure, especially regarding CR.

AB This study contributes to the limited knowledge on the association between community income inequality and adolescent emotional problems, and explores whether these associations are contingent on national income inequality and personal deprivation. We obtained multilevel data from 10,223 adolescents (aged 15-16 years) nested within 82 communities in Iceland, at two time points: (a) in 2006 when income inequality was high and (b) in 2014 when income inequality had decreased. The associations are contingent on time period. Community income inequality was related to (a) an increase in anxiety in 2006 (b=0.337, p 0.05), but not in 2014, and (b) a decrease in depression in 2014 (-0.958, p 0.05), but not in 2006. In 2006, community income inequality was more harmful to adolescents in deprived households. The results support the notion that the detrimental link between income inequality and adolescents' emotional problems may be shaped by the level of income inequality in the larger societal context.

AB The present study investigated the stability of friendship nominations over the course of a school year as a function of early adolescents' and their classroom best friends' internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and somatization). Sample consisted of 156 early adolescents (57.1% female; age = 12.62; SD = 0.62) involved in 78 same-sex best friendship dyads. We assessed best friendship (classroom) nominations at beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the school year. Results of longitudinal analyses performed with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model indicated adolescents' and their classroom best friends' depressive symptoms predicted lower stability of best friendships over time, whereas best friends' somatization emerged as a predictor of higher friendship stability. In addition, positive dyadic friendship quality predicted greater stability over time. These findings highlight the importance of employing a dyadic framework when examining the role of internalizing symptoms in friendship stability.

AB As humans, we have a unique capacity to reflect on our experiences, including emotions. Over time, we develop beliefs about the nature of emotions, and these beliefs are consequential, guiding how we respond to emotions and how we feel as a consequence. One fundamental belief concerns the controllability of emotions: Believing emotions are uncontrollable (entity beliefs) should reduce the likelihood of trying to control emotional experiences using effective regulation strategies like reappraisal; this, in turn, could negatively affect core indices of psychological health, including depressive symptoms. This model holds particular relevance during youth, when emotion-related beliefs first develop and stabilize and when maladaptive beliefs could contribute to emerging risk for depression. In the present investigation, a pilot diary study (N = 223, aged 21-60) demonstrated that entity beliefs were associated with using reappraisal less in everyday life, even when controlling for possible confounds (i.e., self-efficacy, pessimism, stress exposure, stress reactivity). Then, two studies examined whether entity beliefs and associated impairments in reappraisal may set youths on a maladaptive trajectory: In a cross-sectional study (N = 136, aged 14-18), youths with stronger entity beliefs experienced greater depressive symptoms, and this link was mediated by lower reappraisal. This pattern was replicated and extended in a longitudinal study (N = 227, aged 10-18), wherein youth-and parent-reported depressive symptoms were assessed 18 months after assessing beliefs. These results suggest that entity beliefs about emotion constitute a risk factor for depression that acts via reappraisal, adding to the growing literature on emotion beliefs and their consequences for self-regulation and health.

AB Purpose: Victimization is a common problem for many children but is exacerbated for children with a developmental language disorder (DLD). However, the severity of communication problems does not explain their victimization rates. In children without DLD, difficulties with emotional competence are a risk factor for victimization and also increase the risk of bullying. In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which the level and development of emotional competence (understanding of one's own emotions and levels of anger, sadness, and fear) contributed to the prediction of victimization and bullying in children with and without DLD, over and above the type and severity of communication problems of children with DLD.
   Method: Clinically referred youngsters (8-16 years old) with (n = 112; 48% girls, 52% boys) and without (n = 233; 58% girls, 42% boys) DLD completed self-reports 3 times over an 18-month period. Parents of children with DLD reported on their children's communication problems.
   Results: Participants with DLD reported more victimization but comparable levels of bullying behavior compared with peers without DLD. Higher levels of sadness and fear were risk factors for more victimization in both groups. Better understanding of one's own emotions had a larger effect on less victimization in children with DLD, independent of their communication problems. In addition, increased levels of anger and lower levels of understanding of one's own emotions explained more bullying in both groups.
   Conclusion: Outcomes indicate that secondary difficulties in emotional competence in children with DLD make these children more vulnerable to victimization and warrant specific support and interventions.

AB Genetic predispositions play an important role in the development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Understanding the mechanisms through which genetic risk unfolds to influence these developmental outcomes is critical for developing prevention and intervention efforts, capturing key elements of Irv's research agenda and scientific legacy. In this study, we examined the role of parenting and personality in mediating the effect of genetic risk on adolescents' major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Longitudinal data were drawn from a sample of 709 European American adolescents and their mothers from the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism. Results from multivariate path analysis indicated that adolescents' depressive symptoms genome-wide polygenic scores (DS_GPS) predicted lower parental knowledge, which in turn was associated with more subsequent major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Adolescents' DS_GPS also had indirect effects on these outcomes via personality, with a mediating effect via agreeableness but not via other dimensions of personality. Findings revealed that the pattern of associations was similar across adolescent gender. Our findings emphasize the important role of evocative gene-environment correlation processes and intermediate phenotypes in the pathways of risk from genetic predispositions to complex adolescent outcomes.

AB Background: The transition from childhood into adolescence can be considered as a critical developmental period. Moreover, adolescence is associated with a decreased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and an increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies increasing the risk of emotional problems. Targeting emotion regulation is therefore seen as an innovative prevention approach. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Boost camp, an innovative school-based prevention program targeting ER, on adolescents' emotion regulation skills and emotional wellbeing. Also secondary outcomes and possible moderators will be included.
   Methods: The aim is to reach 300 adolescents (16 class groups, 6 schools) in their first year of high school. A clustered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with two conditions, intervention (n = 150) and control (n = 150), will be set up. Adolescents in the intervention condition will receive 14 lessons over the course of 2 days, followed by Booster sessions, and will be compared with adolescents in a non-intervention control group. The outcomes will be measured by self-report questionnaires at baseline, immediately after Boost camp, and at three and 6 months follow-up.
   Discussion: Data-collection is planned to be completed in May 2018. Data-analyses will be finished the end of 2018. The presented paper describes the Boost camp program and the clustered RCT design to evaluate its effectiveness. It is expected that Boost camp will have beneficial effects. If found effective, Boost camp will have the potential to increase adolescent's ER and well-being, and reduce the risk to become adults in need.

AB Background: The association between decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and increased internalizing symptoms is well documented. Adolescence is a critical period for the development of mental health problems, in particular internalizing symptoms. Previous research has illustrated sex differences in adolescent HRV, such that females have reduced short-term resting state HRV compared to males. Studies on long-term ecological recordings of HRV in adolescents are scarce. The aims of the present study were, (a) to test if adolescent females show decreased long-term HRV and cardiac complexity (CC) compared to males, and (b) to explore whether sex and HRV and CC measures, as well as their interaction, would predict internalizing symptoms.
   Materials and Methods: HRV was recorded in n = 166 adolescents (86 girls), on a normal school day. HRV and CC measures were calculated on the interbeat interval time series.
   Results: Females showed lower HRV and CC in most of the assessed indices. Internalizing symptoms were mainly predicted by HRV whereas sex only predicted symptoms of social anxiety. The interaction between sex and HRV did not predict internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that reduced HRV should be considered as a potential contributor to exacerbating internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Girls with reduced HRV and CC might be prone to the development of internalizing disorders. HRV is a promising tool for the early identification of vulnerability.

AB Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the relationships among the lifetime incidence of trauma, internalizing symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) in out-of-school youths (OSYs).
   Methods: We recruited 50 OSYs in South Korea. Participants completed the following surveys: completed Lifetime Incidence of Traumatic Events for children, Youth Self Report, and The KIDSCREEN-27 QoL measure for children and adolescents. Mediation analysis was conducted to test the research hypotheses.
   Results: The mean lifetime incidence of traumatic events among OSYs was 3.27 (standard deviation, 2.41). Internalizing symptoms significantly mediated the lifetime incidence of trauma and QoL. OSYs with fewer internalizing symptoms exhibited a better QoL in the domain of psychological well-being, although their lifetime incidence of trauma was higher.
   Conclusion: The results of current study suggest that assessment and therapeutic intervention with regard to internalizing symptoms are needed to increase the QoL of OSYs.

AB Introduction: Internet addiction is prevalent among adolescents and is associated with various negative outcomes. Relatively few studies examined the role of emotion dysregulation and social support on Internet addiction in this population. The present examined the association between emotion dysregulation, social support, and Internet addiction among junior secondary school students in Hong Kong. The mediating role of emotion dysregulation and Internet use on the relationship between social support and Internet addiction and the gender difference in such association were also tested.
   Method: A total of 862 junior secondary school students (grade 7 to 8) from 4 schools completed a cross-sectional survey.
   Results: 10.9% scored above the cut-off for Internet addiction based on the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that social support was negatively related to emotion dysregulation and Internet usage, which in turn, were positively related to Internet addiction. Results from multi group analysis by gender showed that the relationship between social support and emotion dysregulation, Internet usage, and Internet addiction, and those between emotion dysregulation and Internet addiction and between Internet usage and Internet addiction were stronger among female participants.
   Conclusion: Emotion dysregulation is a potential risk factor while social support is a potential protective factor for Internet addiction. The role of social support on emotion dysregulation and Internet addiction were stronger among female students. Gender-sensitive interventions on Internet Addiction for adolescents are warranted, such interventions should increase social support and improve emotion regulation.

AB The current study examined the potential mediating roles of harsh fathering and harsh mothering in the association between negative parental attribution and emotional dysregulation in Chinese adolescents and explored the moderating role of child gender on this indirect association. 864 students (367 girls, mean age = 13.55 years) with their parents were recruited as participants from two middle schools in Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. The results demonstrated that both harsh fathering and harsh mothering could partially mediate the association between negative maternal attribution and child emotional dysregulation, whereas only harsh fathering could partially mediate the association between negative paternal attribution and child emotional dysregulation. Moreover, we found the moderating role of child gender only for the association between harsh fathering and child emotional dysregulation, in that harsh fathering could be associated with higher levels of emotional dysregulation in girls. These results shed light on efforts to prevent harsh parenting and child emotional dysregulation.

AB Objective: Little is known about the extent to which previous weeks' stressful events spill over and influence adolescents' abilities to derive insight from treatment sessions. Even less is known about factors that moderate clients' vulnerabilities to these spillover effects. The current study examined the spillover of negative interpersonal events to postsession insight and the role of difficulties in emotion regulation in this spillover effect. Method: Participants were 129 adolescents with moderate to severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (M-age = 14.96, 83% female, 56% African American/Black) participating in a comparative efficacy trial of Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) and Family-Enhanced Nondirective Supportive Therapy (FE-NST). A within-subject mediation model tested presession negative affect as a mediator of spillover of past week's events on postsession insight. We then examined baseline difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) as a between-subjects moderator of the mediation model. Results: Negative affect partially mediated (44%) the spillover of the past week's negative events on adolescents' ratings of postsession insight (p = .03, 95% confidence interval, CI [-.09., -.002]). Baseline DERS increased adolescents' vulnerabilities to spillover effects (p = .01, 95% CI [-.28, -.03]). Negative interpersonal events from the past week influence presession negative affect and spill over to adolescents' abilities to gain insight from their treatment sessions. Adolescents who began treatment with greater DERS were particularly vulnerable to these spillover effects. Findings indicate the need for therapists to adapt sessions to individual differences in depressed and suicidal adolescents' exposure to negative interpersonal events preceding treatment and in their vulnerabilities to spillover and emotion dysregulation.

AB Objectives: So far hardly any instruments are available for the German-speaking countries, covering family relations from the perspective of young people reliably. Moreover, the relationship between family relations from the perspective of young people and behavioral problems has been rarely investigated. Method: Based on the Family Relations Test, which has been developed originally for children, the Family Relations Test for Children and Adolescents was developed in order to assess the family relations from the perspective of adolescents (94 items, 44 % newly developed). A clinical sample (n = 152) and a fi eld sample (n = 132) was tested with this instrument and additionally behavioural problems of the adolescents were rated by the parents and the adolescents. Results: The two-factor solution of the principal component analysis resulted in a clear distinction between two factors describing positive and negative family relations. The internal consistencies (Cronbach's Alpha) of the scales describing positive and negative relations are between.91 and.93. On these total scores young people from the clinic sample describe overall stronger negative relations in their families compared to young people in the fi eld sample. Within the clinic sample moderate correlations between the extent of mental problems of young people rated by themselves and their parents could be found. Conclusions: Positive and negative relationships of young people to the individual family members and to all members of the family as a whole can be assessed reliably and factorially valid. As expected, signifi cant correlations between negative family relations and mental problems could be found. The adolescent version of the Family Relations Test for Children and Adolescents proves to be a useful tool, to assess family relationships from the perspective of young people and thus to identify possible factors maintaining mental disorders of young people.

AB The present studies report on the initial development and validation of the Youth Internalizing Problems Screener (YIPS), which is a 10-item self-report rating scale for assessing general internalizing problems and identifying depression and anxiety caseness within the context of school mental health screening. Results from Study 1 (N = 177) demonstrated that responses to the YIPS yielded a single-factor latent structure, that scores derived from the scale had concurrent validity with scores from measures of student subjective well-being and problem behavior, and showed that scores derived from the YIPS demonstrated incremental validity in comparison with scores from another common internalizing problems screener for predicting self-reports of broad student functioning. Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had strong associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety. Taken together, results suggest the YIPS shows promise as a technically adequate instrument for measuring general internalizing problems and identifying depression and anxiety caseness among secondary students. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB Parents are the main socialization agents in the development of emotion regulation (ER). In this study, we evaluated adolescents' and their respective parents' perspectives about their use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) in daily life. In addition, we evaluated the within-family associations between adolescents' and their parents' use of strategies. We controlled for adolescents' gender and age and the perceived quality of their relationships with their parents (mothers and fathers). The sample consisted of 33 12- to 18-year-old adolescent-father-mother triads, totaling 99 participants. Parents and adolescents reported their use of ER strategies in response to eight random prompts throughout the day, by means of the experience sampling method for 1 week. Participants provided 4082 reports on their momentary experiences. The data were analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the repeated daily assessments. The significant association between parents' and adolescents' use of ER strategies was specific to mother-adolescent dyads. The significant association between adolescents' and their mothers' ER strategies varied as a function of the adolescents' age and the quality of their relationship with their mothers according to adolescents' reports, but not as a function of adolescent gender. These findings suggest that mothers have a role in their adolescents' emotion regulation in a developmental period characterized by autonomy from parental guidance.

AB The researchers examined differential outcomes related to two distinct motivations for withdrawal (preference for solitude and shyness) as well as the possibility that support from important others (mothers, fathers, and best friends) attenuate any such links. Adolescents (159 males, 171 females) reported on their motivations to withdraw, internalizing symptoms, and relationship quality in eighth grade, as well as their anxiety and depression in ninth grade. Using structural equation modeling, the authors found that maternal support weakened the association between shyness and internalizing problems; friend support weakened the association between preference for solitude and depression; and friend support strengthened the association between shyness and depression. Results suggest that shy adolescents may not derive the same benefits from supportive friendships as their typical peers.

AB Although exposure to natural disasters can lead to diverse mental health (MH) outcomes in youth, most child disaster MH research has focused on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). To highlight the likelihood of other MH outcomes, we meta-analyzed studies that have examined other (non-PTSS) internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in youth exposed to natural disasters. We used PRISMA guidelines to systematically gather studies that have examined the association between natural disaster exposure and non-PTSS internalizing and/or externalizing problems in samples of children and adolescents. Analyses of random effects models of 62 studies examining non-PTSS internalizing problems and 26 studies examining externalizing problems showed exposure to natural disasters was significantly associated with non-PTSS internalizing, r(mean) = .18, k = 70, and externalizing problems, r(mean) = .08; k = 31, in youth. Moderator analyses revealed a stronger association between disaster exposure and non-PTSS internalizing problems in countries with a medium Human Development Index (HDI) ranking, r = .56, than in countries with high, r = .15, and very high, r = .16, HDI rankings. We also found a stronger association between disaster exposure and externalizing problems in countries with a medium HDI ranking, r = .54, versus high, r = .05, and very high, r = .04, HDI rankings, and based on parent, r = .16, compared to child, r = -.01, report. Results support the need for assessment of multiple postdisaster MH outcomes to inform comprehensive interventions. We also include a discussion of the state of the disaster MH research.

AB Adolescents who lack friends at school are at risk of internalizing difficulties. This study examined a social-cognitive mechanism underlying friendlessness and internalizing difficulties (i.e., depressive symptoms, social anxiety, low self-esteem). We tested whether perceived social threat (i.e., peer victimization, sense of unsafety, and peer misconduct) mediates the association between friendlessness and increased internalizing difficulties across middle school. Latent variable structural equation modeling was used to test the model among an ethnically diverse sample of 5,991 (52% female) adolescents. The results demonstrate that friendless sixth-grade students perceived their school environment as more threatening by seventh grade, which in turn, increased internalizing difficulties from sixth to eighth grade. Perceptions of threat also predicted friendlessness at the end of middle school.

AB OBJECTIVE: With this study, we examined the efficacy of a health intervention program that was focused on emotion regulation (ER) skills in reducing sexual risk behaviors among early adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms.
   METHODS: Seventh grade adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms participated in a 6-week, after-school sexual risk prevention trial in which a counterbalanced, within-school design comparing an ER focused program to a time- and attention-matched comparison group was used. Adolescents completed a computer-based survey regarding their sexual behavior at 6-month intervals for 2.5 years.
   RESULTS: Adolescents who received ER skills training exhibited a delay in the transition to vaginal sex over 30 months compared with those in the comparison condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [0.42 to 0.89]). They also reported fewer instances of condomless sex over the follow-up period (adjusted rate ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval [0.14 to 0.90]). Among those who were sexually active, those in the ER condition reported fewer instances of vaginal or anal sex (adjusted rate ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [0.32 to 0.99]).
   CONCLUSIONS: An intervention used to teach ER skills for the context of health decision-making resulted in lower risk among young adolescents with suspected mental health symptoms by delaying the onset of vaginal sex as well as reducing penetrative acts without a condom. Incorporating emotion education into health education may have important health implications for this age group.

AB Background: Although the association between somatic complaints and internalizing problems (anxiety, somatic anxiety and depression) is well established, it remains unclear whether the pattern of this relationship differs by gender and in different cultures. The aim of this study was to examine cross-cultural and gender-specific differences in the association between somatic complaints and internalizing problems in youth from the Czech Republic and Russia. Methods: The Social and Health Assessment, a self-report survey, was completed by representative community samples of adolescents, age 12-17 years, from the Czech Republic (N = 4770) and Russia (N = 2728). Results: A strong association was observed between somatic complaints and internalizing psychopathology. Although the levels of internalizing problems differed by country and gender, they increased together with and largely in a similar way to somatic complaints for boys and girls in both countries. Conclusion: The association between somatic symptoms and internalizing problems seems to be similar for boys and girls across cultures.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) becomes increasingly important across adolescent development, and promotes psychological flexibility, resilience and well-being in youth. Positive education programs (PEPs) combine academic training with positive psychology interventions (PPIs) to increase well-being and reduce mental ill-health. Despite considerable overlap between PPIs and ER models, the role and relevance of ER to PEPs remains unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the relationship of ER to PEPs targeting adolescents. First, to evaluate the relationship of ER to domains of well-being targeted by school-based PPIs. Second, to examine whether school-based PPIs can improve adolescents' ER capacity. Third, to evaluate the role of ER in well-being outcomes of PEPs. Results support the relevance of ER to domains of well-being outlined by the revised PERMA model, including positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and health. ER can influence the degree to which students benefit from PEP participation. It remains to be determined whether ER capacity is improved as a result of exposure to positive education programs. Findings are limited by the small and heterogeneous group of interventions examined, and the use of inconsistent ER measures. Further research of the role of ER in positive education may contribute to greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness and further promote the psychological well-being of adolescents.

AB In typically-developing (TD) individuals, effective emotion regulation strategies have been associated with positive outcomes in various areas, including social functioning. Although impaired social functioning is a core criterion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the role of emotion regulation ability in ASD has been largely ignored. This study investigated the association between emotion regulation and ASD symptomatology, with a specific emphasis on social impairment. We used parent-report questionnaires to assess the regulatory strategies and symptom severity of 145 youth with ASD. Results showed that: (1) more effective emotion regulation, defined by greater use of reappraisal, predicted less severe ASD symptomatology, and (2) greater use of reappraisal predicted less severe social impairment. Suppression was not predictive of general symptomatology or social functioning.

AB Following the theoretical propositions of the Emotion Regulation model of attachment, the current study investigated whether attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance might play a differential contributing role in the development of bulimic symptoms, through assumed differences in adopting specific maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in a sample of adolescents. Developmentally appropriate self-report questionnaires were administered to a community sample of 397 adolescents (Mean age: 14.02; 62.7% female) and this at 2 time points with a 1-year time lag. Results provided longitudinal evidence for the Emotion Regulation model of attachment in confirming the differential contributing role of the attachment dimensions on the development of bulimic symptoms in a sample of adolescents. More specifically, attachment anxiety seemed to be related to bulimic symptoms through rumination, while attachment avoidance through emotional control. These results may have clinical implications for assessment and treatment of bulimic symptoms in adolescents.

AB Objective: Sexual abuse experienced in childhood and adolescence is associated with severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties. The current study examined the relationships among these factors in a sample of adolescents with sexual abuse-related PTSD. It was hypothesized that (a) self-perceived emotion regulation difficulties would predict severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and that (b) depressive symptoms would mediate the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD. Method: Ninety treatment-seeking female adolescents with a history of sexual abuse were evaluated using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview and completed the Negative Mood Regulation Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory as part of a baseline evaluation. Results: Greater emotion regulation difficulties were associated with greater severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms. In addition, the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD severity was mediated by depressive symptoms. However, the reverse was also true: the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms was mediated by PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Mediation analyses showed that emotion regulation difficulties were associated with both PTSD and depressive symptoms rather than fitting a unidirectional model. These findings are consistent with and extend previous research and highlight the importance of emotion regulation in adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

AB This article presents the findings of a study that examined the rates and the consequences of exposure to community violence (ECV) as reflected in witnessing and experiencing such violence, among Palestinian adolescents from Israel. In particular, it examined the extent to which these adolescents exhibit high levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms as consequences of such exposure, and the extent to which self-efficacy and collective efficacy moderate these consequences. A systematic random sample of 760 Palestinian adolescents in Israel (320 boys, and 440 girls) filled out a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that most of the adolescents had witnessed community violence during the last year and during lifetime, and more than one third had directly experienced such violence during their lifetime compared with 19.6% during the last year. Boys were exposed to community violence more often than girls. Moreover, participants' ECV predicted high levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that collective efficacy moderated the correlation between experiencing community violence and internalizing symptoms, whereas self-efficacy moderated the correlation between witnessing community violence and externalizing symptoms. There is a need for providing support for youth from close adults as well as from formal and informal resources in the community before and after their ECV.

AB This article presents research aimed to investigate the effect of perceived social support on an individual's resilience, with the assumption that it is, at least partially, indirect and that it is achieved through cognitive emotion regulation strategies. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used with a sample group of young adults, comprising 319 respondents from a student population of both genders. The results indicated that the perceived support of family, friends, and a significant other is a significant predictive factor for resilience-the more present these factors are, the greater the resilience. The relationship between the perceived support of friends and resilience is partially direct, and partially indirect, whereby both planning and positive reappraisal have the role of mediators. These results lead to the conclusion that the perceived support of friends is a significant protective factor for mental health, partially because of the fact that it makes an individual more prepared to see a certain stressful situation as an opportunity for personal growth and to actively confront it.

AB Background: Internalizing problems are the most prevalent mental health problems in adolescents. Transdiagnostic programs are promising manners to treat multiple problems within the same protocol, however, there is limited research regarding the efficacy of such programs delivered as universal prevention programs in school settings. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of a video-based transdiagnostic rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT) universal prevention program, for internalizing problems. The second objective of the present paper will be to investigate the subsequent mechanisms of change, namely maladaptive cognitions.
   Methods: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted, with two groups: a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program and a wait list control. Power analysis indicated that the study will involve 338 participants. Adolescents with ages between 12 and 17 years old, from several middle schools and high schools, will be invited to participate. Assessments will be conducted at four time points: baseline (T-1), postintervention (T-2), 3 months follow-up (T-3) and 12 months follow-up (T-4). Intent-to-treat analysis will be used in order to investigate significant differences between the two groups in both primary and secondary outcomes.
   Discussion: This is the first randomized controlled trial that aims to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of change of a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program, delivered in a school context. The present study has important implications for developing efficient prevention programs, interactive, that will aim to target within the same protocol both anxiety and depressive symptoms.

AB Mindfulness has been demonstrated to have positive effects on children's emotional functioning, and adaptive parenting practices are associated with fewer emotional problems. However, the association between mindful parenting and adolescent emotional problems has not been studied much. In the current study, the indirect path from mindful parenting to adolescent emotional problems was examined, with maternal warmth and adolescent dispositional mindfulness as potential mediators. A sample of 168 mother-child dyads participated in this study. A serial indirect effects model showed mother's mindful parenting could decrease adolescent emotional problems through adolescent's perceived maternal warmth and their dispositional mindfulness. Findings of this study imply that intervention in mindful parenting may have benefits for adolescents' emotional problems through enhancing maternal warmth and children's trait mindfulness.

AB Intrapersonal emotion regulation refers to individuals' ability to effectively manage and respond to their own emotional experience. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) is one of the main self-reporting tools assessing intrapersonal emotion regulation in middle age children and adolescents. This instrument measures the frequency of use of two types of emotion regulation strategies, the cognitive reappraisal and the expressive suppression. The ERQ-CA only focused on the frequency of use of these strategies, thus a parallel set of items measuring the efficacy of use of the cognitive reappraisal and of the expressive suppression has been recently proposed in adults. As no self-reporting tool assessing emotion regulation in middle-age children has yet been validated in a French sample, this study aimed to validate the French version of the ERQ-CA and the parallel set of items exploring the efficacy of use of the two emotion regulation strategies in children and adolescents. A power analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation recommended a sample size of 140 participants. Therefore, a total of 140 children and adolescents (66 girls, mean age = 12.30 years; SD = 2.59 years; range = 8-16 years) were included in this study. Confirmatory Factorial Analyses confirmed the soundness of the two-factor solution for the ERQ-CA and the parallel set of items (RMSEA <.058; SRMR <.063; CFI >.93). Given the low numbers of items in the ERQ-CA, internal consistency was good (alpha >.70). This study confirmed that the ERQ-CA is an appropriate instrument to assess the frequency of use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in children and adolescents. In addition, this study demonstrated the validity of the parallel set of items to evaluate the efficacy of use of these two strategies. The combination of these two instruments should thus contribute to increase our understanding of the development of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in children and adolescents. Further studies should be conducted to establish robust norms that can be useful in clinical practice.

AB This article provides a quantitative and conceptual review of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed young people, and informs future directions in the field. Despite long-standing interest in the influence of emotion regulation difficulties on different internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders in childhood, several questions remain unresolved with respect to children and adolescents with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Meta-analytic data from adult victims suggest that emotion regulation problems are associated with PTSD, but this has never been studied in children and young people. We therefore provide a conceptual review of features related to the phenomenology, assessment, severity and treatment of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed children and young people. We combine this with a meta-analysis of published literature. We searched studies in Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase databases based on pre-selected criteria. Eight hundred and eighty-six papers were identified and 41 were included. We found that children and adolescents with a diagnosis of PTSD reported more emotion regulation difficulties than those who did not develop PTSD, and that the overall association between the two symptom dimensions was moderately strong. We identify a number of research priorities: the development of instruments to assess emotion regulation difficulties in children, the design of studies that describe its prevalence in young epidemiological traumatized samples, its predictive role in the onset, severity and persistence of post-traumatic symptoms, and its relevance as a moderator, outcome or treatment target for young survivors.

AB Background: The co-occurrence of disordered eating and alcohol use and misuse has frequently been highlighted in literature.
   Method: The first aim of the present study was to examine the association of drunkorexia with various disordered eating behaviors and alcohol consumption in a sample of male and female adolescents. The second goal was to investigate the motivations underlying drunkorexia and the third goal was to examine the relationship between drunkorexia and different dimensions of emotion regulation. One thousand adolescents (608 females and 392 males; range 16-21) completed a survey of self-report measures.
   Results: Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that fasting and engaging in binge drinking and getting drunk were significant predictors of drunkorexia in both males and females; furthermore, females were found to engage in drunkorexia mainly for enhancement motives. Conversely, drunkorexia in males was significantly predicted by difficulties regulating emotions.
   Conclusion: This research suggests that disordered eating and alcohol use similarly contribute to drunkorexia in male and female adolescents, even though highlights important gender differences.

AB A dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) group has been conducted for a number of years at a public outpatient clinic for adolescents suffering with emotional regulation difficulties and their families. A detailed account of the rationale, design, and content of both the adolescent and parent groups are provided. Data from these groups adds to the limited evidence regarding the efficacy of such groups. A retrospective analysis of changes in the adolescent participants' emotional dysregulation, depression, anxiety and stress, following their participation in the group (N = 12) was conducted. Several substantial improvements were noted across the measures of psychopathology, following the completion of the group. These findings support the teaching of DBT skills to adolescents and their families, with some modifications being appropriate for their application to this population. Future avenues for research stemming from the group program are also discussed.

AB The present study examines whether early adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation mediate the relation between parents' self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation and early adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants were 534 early adolescents (T1: M age = 10.89, SD = .70; 50% female), their mothers (n = 534), and their fathers (n = 431). Families were drawn from Colombia, Italy, and the USA. Follow-up data were obtained two (T2) and three (T3) years later. At T1 and T3, parents' self-efficacy beliefs were self reported and internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed via mothers', fathers', and early adolescents' reports. At T2, early adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs were self-reported Within the overall sample, mothers with higher self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation had children with similar beliefs. Early adolescents' low self-efficacy beliefs were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB This study aimed to characterize adolescent family functioning typologies using latent profile analysis (LPA). A secondary aim was to examine profile associations with adolescent internalizing symptoms at one-year follow-up. Students (N = 1029; 53% female; mean age = 16.14, SD = .75 years) completed measures of family functioning, anxiety, and depressive symptoms at two time points. LPA was conducted to characterize family functioning typologies at Time 1, revealing five profiles: 1) Low Family Functioning, 2) Only Close to Father, 3) Average Family Functioning, 4) Only Close to Mother, and 5) High Family Functioning. Results indicated that the Low and Only Close to Mother profiles had greater depressive symptoms at Time 2, compared with the Average profile. The High profile had fewer depressive symptoms at Time 2. The Low and Only Close to Mother profiles also had significantly more anxiety symptoms at Time 2. Findings highlight the utility of examining family functioning profiles.

AB Compared with other ethnic groups, African American adolescents are exposed to higher levels of family and community violence, which contribute to poorer academic achievement. This study examines whether emotion regulation moderates the effects of exposure to family and community violence on academic achievement among low-income African American adolescents. Eighty African American adolescents (X age 12.89 years, 50% male) reported on their exposure to violence. Emotion regulation was obtained from parent reports and academic achievement was assessed with grades in core academic subjects at baseline and 2 years later. Results revealed that witnessing home violence predicted poorer achievement over time, as did exposure to community violence for youth with poor emotion regulation. Thus, well-developed emotion regulation skills may protect African American adolescents from the negative effects of witnessing community violence on academic achievement.

ID ANEMIA; BEHAVIOR; SCALE
AB Objective To evaluate associations between iron supplementation and iron deficiency in infancy and internalizing, externalizing, and social problems in adolescence.
   Study design The study is a follow-up of infants as adolescents from working-class communities around Santiago, Chile who participated in a preventive trial of iron supplementation at 6 months of age. Inclusionary criteria included birth weight >= 3.0 kg, healthy singleton term birth, vaginal delivery, and a stable caregiver. Iron status was assessed at 12 and 18 months of age. At 11-17 years of age, internalizing, externalizing, and social problems were reported by 1018 adolescents with the Youth Self Report and by parents with the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results Adolescents who received iron supplementation in infancy had greater self-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but lower parent-reported conduct disorder symptoms than those who did not (Ps<.05). Iron deficiency with or without anemia at 12 or 18 months of age predicted greater adolescent behavior problems compared with iron sufficiency: more adolescent-reported anxiety and social problems, and parent-reported social, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant, conduct, aggression, and rule breaking problems (Ps <.05). The threshold was iron deficiency with or without anemia for each of these outcomes.
   Conclusions Iron deficiency with or without anemia in infancy was associated with increased internalizing, externalizing, and social problems in adolescence.

AB Family functioning significantly impacts family processes. When children enter adolescence the need to develop and maintain a high level of family functioning becomes even more crucial. This study examined whether parents' individual characteristics contributed to family cohesion/adaptability in families with adolescents. Moreover, the mediating roles that parent-adolescent relationships played in these associations were also examined. Participants were 169 father-mother couples in families with at least one adolescent child in Mainland China. Fathers and mothers reported on difficulties in emotion regulation, perceptions of parent-adolescent closeness and conflict, and family cohesion and adaptability. Results revealed that both paternal and maternal emotion dysregulation were indirectly related to their own and their partner's perceptions of family cohesion through their own closeness or conflict with the adolescent child. A parent's emotion dysregulation could be directly and indirectly related to his/her own perception of family adaptability through his/her own closeness with the adolescent, while another parent's emotion dysregulation could be indirectly associated with his/her partner's report of family adaptability through his/her own conflict with the adolescent. These findings suggested that family functioning during adolescence might be impacted by family factors at the individual parental and parent-adolescent dyadic levels. Additionally, this study indicated fathers and mothers might contribute to the family processes in a similar way.

AB Although numerous studies have described the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation and internalizing symptoms among adolescents, research using hair cortisol concentrations in pre- and young adolescent samples has not been reported. We investigated the association of self-reported internalizing symptoms with cortisol concertration in hair among pre-and young adolescents aged 10-12 years. Forty-six boys and 39 girls supplied a hair sample of at least 3 cm in length for an analysis of this period (3 months) cortisol excretion. Saliva cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) also was assessed. The study found a positive association between ratings of depressive symptoms and cumulative levels of hair cortisol only in boys. Furthermore, higher ratings of anxiety symptoms were associated with lower hair cortisol concertration and lower saliva cortisol reactivity among girls. This study provides the first evidence for the notion that depressive symptoms in boys are associated with long-term cortisol concertration in hair, whereas anxiety symptoms in girls are associated with HPA-axis hypoactivity, when hair cortisol concentrations and saliva cortisol reactivity to acute stress are assessed concurrently.

AB In this study, we examined whether peer appearance-related victimization was associated with adolescents' increasing body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) symptoms over 12 months. Also, given emotion regulation and mindfulness have been associated with less body dissatisfaction, we expected that they would protect against the negative impact of peer victimization on BDD symptoms. Participants were 367 Australian adolescents (M-age = 13 years). In multiple regressions, two aspects of emotion regulation, strategies and clarity, and two components of mindfulness, acting with awareness and being non-judgmental, were uniquely associated with fewer BDD symptoms at T2 relative to T1. There was evidence that one mindfulness component, observing, was a risk factor for more BDD symptoms. Further, acting with awareness and observing moderated the prospective relationship between victimization and BDD symptoms; low acting with awareness and high observing were risks for symptoms regardless of victimization, whereas high acting with awareness and low observing appeared protective of BDD symptoms, but only for adolescents who reported lower victimization.

AB Adolescents' close friendships are an important and unique learning context in which adolescents can practice and hone their emotion regulation skills within an egalitarian, supportive relationship structure that provides important feedback on the effectiveness of the regulation strategies. This longitudinal study examined whether adolescents' involvement in supportive reciprocal friendships influenced the way in which they regulated angry feelings arising in these friendships. A sample of 299 German adolescents began a 30-month, 3-wave longitudinal study in grade 7 (151 boys, M age = 12.6 years; 100% White). They completed a social network inventory (LueNIC), a peer-nomination measure, and the questionnaire on Strategies of Anger Regulation for Adolescents (SAR-A) in every wave. Cross-lagged-panel modeling indicated a pattern of socialization effects even when controlling for previous friendship involvement, previous anger regulation, peer acceptance, gender, classroom membership, and possible friendship selection influences. Adolescents with more reciprocal friends at Time 1 (T1) reported using aggressive strategies of anger regulation (i.e., verbal and relational aggression, fantasies of revenge) and ignoring the friend less often at Time 2 (T2). Similar results were obtained between T2 and Time 3 (T3). There was a marginally significant effect for one of three non-aggressive strategies such that a higher involvement in friendships at T2 explained more reappraisal of the anger-eliciting event at T3 but significant effects did not emerge for the strategies of redirection of attention and explanation and reconciliation. The results are discussed within a socialization of emotion framework with implications for social skills training modules.

AB IntroductionAdolescents who live in rural areas have been found to experience more mental health problems than those who live in urban areas. In Indonesia, adolescents who live in rural areas have limited facilities to access mental health services. On the other hand, there is still a strong belief in the rural communities that mental health problems are the consequence of demonic possession, having committed a sin, lack of faith, etc. Rural communities tend to seek traditional remedies such as advice from traditional healers or witchdoctors. Unfortunately, previous studies have indicated that the onset of most mental health problems is during adolescence, and this includes psychotic symptoms that are often manifested as psychotic-like experiences (PLEs).
   MethodsThe Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to examine internalizing problems. PLEs were used to examine psychotic symptoms. Data were collected in 3 junior high schools in Karawang. A total of 270 adolescents (aged between 11 and 16years old) who live in the rural area in Karawang participated in this research.
   ResultsThe study found that the prevalence of adolescents with at least 2 symptoms of PLEs was 7%. The result of the study indicated that there is no significant correlation between psychotic-like experiences and internalizing problems (r=.075, P=.22).
   DiscussionPLEs significantly correlated with peer-relationship problems rather than with internalizing problems. Further investigation is needed to examine the factors that contribute to PLEs in rural settings.

AB Although community violence is an established risk factor for youth aggression, less research has examined its relation with internalizing psychopathology. This study examined associations of community violence exposure with internalizing symptoms, and state and trait emotion dysregulation as mechanisms underlying these associations, in 287 adolescents aged 16-17 (45.6% male; 40.8% White). Community violence exposure was associated with internalizing symptoms, negative affect during peer evaluation, trait emotional reactivity, and infrequent problem solving. Multiple emotion dysregulation indices were also associated with internalizing symptoms. In simultaneous multiple mediator models, indirect effects of community violence on internalizing problems were significantly explained by state and trait emotion dysregulation. Findings implicate emotion dysregulation as one mechanism linking community violence exposure to adolescent internalizing symptoms.

AB ObjectivesLow positive emotionality (PE) represents a temperamental vulnerability to depression in youth. Until now, little research has examined the mechanisms linking PE to depressive symptoms. Starting from integrated cognitive-affective models of depression, we aimed to study adaptive emotion regulation (ER) as a key underlying mechanism in the temperament-depression relationship.
   MethodsThis study investigated whether adaptive ER strategies mediate the association between PE and depressive symptoms in a large community-based sample of youth, using a cross-sectional design. Participants were 1,655 youth (54% girls; 7-16years, M=11.41, SD=1.88) who filled out a set of questionnaires assessing temperament, adaptive ER strategies, and depressive symptoms.
   ResultsResults revealed that low PE was significantly related to higher depressive symptoms among youth and that a lack of total adaptive ER abilities mediated this relationship. More specifically, the infrequent use of problem-solving appeared to be of significant importance. Problems in positive refocusing and a deficient use of forgetting mediated the relationships between low PE and high negative emotionality (NE) in predicting depressive symptoms. Reappraisal and distraction were not significant mediators.
   ConclusionResults highlight the need to account for temperamental PE and adaptive ER strategies when studying youth depression. The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding on the differential role of temperamental risk factors for developing depressive symptoms at an early stage and advocate for greater attention to adaptive ER strategies.

AB Numerous data demonstrate that distracting emotional stimuli cause behavioral slowing (i.e. emotional conflict) and that behavior dynamically adapts to such distractors. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms that mediate these behavioral findings are poorly understood. Several theoretical models have been developed that attempt to explain these phenomena, but these models have not been directly tested on human behavior nor compared. A potential tool to overcome this limitation is Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM), which is a computational approach to modeling indirectly observed systems. Here, we administered an emotional Stroop task to a sample of healthy adolescent girls (N = 24) during fMRI and used HMM to implement theoretical behavioral models. We then compared the model fits and tested for neural representations of the hidden states of the most supported model. We found that a modified variant of the model posited by Mathews et al. (1998) was most concordant with observed behavior and that brain activity was related to the model-based hidden states. Particularly, while the valences of the stimuli themselves were encoded primarily in the ventral visual cortex, the model-based detection of threatening targets was associated with increased activity in the bilateral anterior insula, while task effort (i.e. adaptation) was associated with reduction in the activity of these areas. These findings suggest that emotional target detection and adaptation are accomplished partly through increases and decreases, respectively, in the perceived immediate relevance of threatening cues and also demonstrate the efficacy of using HMM to apply theoretical models to human behavior.

AB The present study investigated the role of afternoon cortisol in social-emotional competence and peer acceptance in early adolescence. To date, research on basal cortisol activity and social development in childhood and adolescence has predominately focused on understanding maladjustment and dysfunction in development. The degree to which basal cortisol is also involved in positive adjustment and social functioning remains largely unexplored. A total of 154 early adolescents (46% female; Mean age = 11.26; SD = .65) from diverse ethnic backgrounds provided self-reports of perspective taking, peer reports of acceptance by classmates, peer reports of prosocial behaviors, and saliva samples to assess basal cortisol. As expected and in alignment with previous research, afternoon cortisol, perspective taking, prosocial behaviors, and peer acceptance were all positively correlated. Path analyses followed by bootstrapping analyses revealed that the direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to higher levels of prosocial behavior was fully mediated by perspective taking skills. The direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to peer acceptance was fully mediated by perspective taking skills and prosocial behavior. The findings are discussed within the broader context of previous research on cortisol and social adjustment in childhood and early adolescence. The practical relevance of the findings is considered.

AB Externalizing symptoms robustly predict adolescent substance use (SU); however, findings regarding internalizing symptoms have been mixed, suggesting that there may be important moderators of the relationship between internalizing problems and SU. The present study used a longitudinal community sample (N = 387, 55% female, 83% White) to test whether externalizing symptoms moderated the relationship between internalizing symptoms and trajectories of alcohol and marijuana use from early (age 11-12 years old) to late (age 18-19 years old) adolescence. Two-part latent growth models were used to distinguish trajectories of probability of use from trajectories of amount of use among users. Results suggested that externalizing symptoms moderated the association between internalizing symptoms and probability of alcohol, but not marijuana use. The highest probability of alcohol use was observed at high levels of externalizing symptoms and low levels of internalizing symptoms. A negative protective effect of internalizing symptoms on probability of alcohol use was strongest in early adolescence for youth high on externalizing symptoms. Although moderation was not supported for amount of use among users, both domains of symptomology were associated with amount of alcohol and marijuana use as first-order effects. High levels of externalizing symptoms and low levels of internalizing symptoms were associated with high levels of amount of use among users. These findings suggest that developmental models of substance use that incorporate internalizing symptomology should consider the context of externalizing problems and distinguish probability and amount of use.

AB Prevention programs that strengthen parenting and family functioning have been found to reduce poor behavioral outcomes in adolescents, including substance use, HIV risk, externalizing and internalizing problems. However, there is evidence that not all youth benefit similarly from these programs. Familias Unidas is a family-focused intervention designed to prevent substance use and sexual risk among Hispanic youth and has recently demonstrated unanticipated reductions in internalizing symptoms for some youth. This paper examines variation in intervention response for internalizing symptoms using individual-level data pooled across four distinct Familias Unidas trials: (1) 266 eighth grade students recruited from the general school population; (2) 160 ninth grade students from the general school population; (3) 213 adolescents with conduct, aggression, and/or attention problems; and (4) 242 adolescents with a delinquency history. Causal inference growth mixture modeling suggests a threeclass model. The two largest classes represent youth with low (60 %) and medium (27 %) internalizing symptoms at baseline, and both intervention and control participants show reductions in internalizing symptoms. The third class (13 %) represents youth with high levels of baseline internalizing symptoms who remain at steady levels of internalizing symptoms when exposed to the intervention, but who experience an increase in symptoms under the control condition. Female gender, low baseline levels of parent-adolescent communication, and older age were associated with membership in the high-risk class. These synthesis analyses involving a large sample of youth with varying initial risk levels represent a further step toward strengthening our knowledge of preventive intervention response and improving preventive interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: Research on the neural correlates associated with risk for suicidal ideation (SI) has been limited, particularly in one increasingly at-risk group-adolescents. Previous research with adolescents indicates that poor emotion regulation skills are linked with SI, but these studies have not previously examined neural activation in service of emotion regulation between those with and without SI histories.
   METHODS: Here we examine whether SI is associated with neural responses during an emotion regulation functional magnetic resonance imaging task in a group of adolescents (N = 49) 13 to 20 years of age (mean = 16.95).
   RESULTS: While there were no differences between youths with and without SI in self-reported emotional responses to negative pictures, youths with SI activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex more than youths without SI on trials in which they attempted to regulate their emotional responses compared with trials in which they passively viewed negative pictures. In contrast, during passive viewing of negative stimuli, youths with SI activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and cerebellum less than same-age control subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings were robust to control subjects for depression and adversity exposure and are consistent with the idea that youths with SI have disrupted emotion regulation, potentially related to differences in recruitment of top-down control regions. In contrast, youths without SI activated regions implicated in emotion regulation even when not directed to effortfully control their emotional response. This is the first study to examine neural function during emotion regulation as a potential neural correlate of risk for SI in adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND: Externalizing behaviors are negative behaviors expressed outwardly, including rule breaking, aggression, and risk taking; internalizing behaviors are expressed inwardly, including depression, withdrawal, and anxiety. Such behavior can cause problems in early life and predict difficulties across the lifespan. There is evidence for a relationship between executive function and both externalizing and internalizing. However, although these behaviors occur along a spectrum, there is little neuroimaging research on this relationship in typically developing youth.
   METHODS: We assessed 41 youth (10-19 years of age) using the Multi-Source Interference Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging and related the findings to self-reported externalizing and internalizing scores as measured by the Youth Self-Report. We performed a general linear model using FSL software; externalizing, internalizing, age, and sex were included in the model.
   RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, the more difficult Multi-Source Interference Task interference condition was associated with greater engagement of the frontoparietal cognitive control system and decreased engagement of regions in the default mode network, based on a cluster threshold of Z > 3.1 (p = .01). When we examined regions uniquely associated with either internalizing or externalizing, we found that within the same group of subjects, higher externalizing behavior was associated with hyperactivity in the parietal lobe; in contrast, higher internalizing behavior was associated with increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that externalizing and internalizing may be associated with altered, but different, patterns of activation during cognitive control. This has implications for our understanding of the relationship between cognitive control and behavioral problems in youth.

AB There is growing evidence linking emotion dysregulation to anxiety. However, few studies have examined this relationship longitudinally or developmentally. Additionally, no studies have specifically examined the predictive relevance of the emotion regulation skills taught in mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapies. We explore whether specific emotion regulation processes differentially predict specific anxiety symptoms over time among children and adolescents. Methods: Initial emotion non-awareness, nonacceptance, and difficulties with goal-directed behavior were assessed in a community sample (n=312, age range=8-16, mean age=11.68, 59% female, 69% Caucasian). Social anxiety, separation anxiety, and physical anxiety symptoms were assessed every 3months for 3years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the concurrent and longitudinal effects of emotion dysregulation assessed at baseline or 18months on anxiety. Results: After controlling for depression, age, and gender, all three processes concurrently predicted physical and social anxiety, and all but nonacceptance predicted separation anxiety. Only difficulties with goal-directed behavior, however, predicted longitudinal change in separation anxiety over time with covariates. Additionally, emotion non-awareness and difficulties with goal-directed behavior predicted subsequent changes in social anxiety. Conclusions: Emotion dysregulation may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of anxiety symptoms among youth. It may be beneficial to target reductions in maladaptive strategies in prevention or intervention work.

AB Temperamental approach is associated with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Negative family affective expression, or problematic communication about emotions, is also associated with youth's risk for symptoms. However, it is unclear whether negative family affective expression differentially predicts symptoms based on (a) youth's temperamental approach and (b) informants' perceptions of negative family affective expression. To address these issues, we explored whether mother-, father-, and youth-reported negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth temperamental approach and symptoms. Participants were 775 youths (71% male, 76% Caucasian) assessed at ages 10-12 (Time 1) and 12-14 (Time 2). Mothers, fathers, and youths reported on negative family affective expression and youths reported on temperamental approach at Time 1. Teachers reported on youth symptoms at Times 1 and 2. Youth- and father-reported, but not mother-reported, negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth approach and symptoms. When youths reported higher negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. In contrast, when fathers reported lower negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. Assessments and interventions for youth symptoms should include not only temperamental features, but also multiple informants' perspectives of family affective expression. Such efforts could promote greater family communication, address problematic family dynamics, and potentially attenuate risk for youth symptoms.

AB Recent research suggests that impaired emotion regulation (ER) may play an important role in the development of youth psychopathology. However, little research has explored the effects of ER strategies on affect in early adolescents. In Study 1 (n = 76), we examined if early adolescents are able to use distraction and whether the effects of this strategy are similar to talking to one's mother. In Study 2 (n = 184), we compared the effects of distraction, cognitive reappraisal, acceptance, and rumination. In both studies, participants received instructions on how to regulate their emotions after a standardised negative mood induction. In general, the results indicated that distraction, but also cognitive reappraisal and acceptance, had promising short-term effects on positive and negative affect in early adolescents. These findings suggest that targeting adaptive ER skills, such as distraction, acceptance, and cognitive reappraisal, may be an important strategy to prevent or treat psychological problems in early adolescents.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which cognitive emotion regulation strategies were common or transdiagnostic correlates of symptoms of depression and anxiety and/or specific correlates distinguishing one problem category from the other. The sample comprised 582 13- to 16-year-old secondary school students. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured by the SCL-90, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were measured by the CERQ, in a cross-sectional design. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. Before controlling for comorbidity, the same cognitive emotion regulation strategies that were related to symptoms of depression were also related to symptoms of anxiety. However, after controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms, rumination, self-blame (only girls), positive reappraisal, and positive refocusing (the latter two inversely) were uniquely (and significantly) associated with depression symptoms; and after controlling for comorbid depression symptoms, catastrophising and other-blame were uniquely related to anxiety symptoms. The results supported the cognitive content-specificity model, in which anxiety is supposed to be uniquely characterised by thoughts concerning the overestimation of threats and harm, and depression is supposed to be uniquely characterised by negative evaluations of self, and of past and future events.

AB Objectives: African American (AA) adolescents face a greater risk of internalizing symptoms, including symptoms of both depression and anxiety, compared with other racial groups; yet, relatively less is known about the variables that contribute to internalizing symptoms. With the aim of advancing this work, this study examined factors that may buffer against such symptoms (maternal warmth, religiosity), as well as those that may confer additional risk (maternal psychopathology). Method: One hundred ninety-three AA single mothers and their adolescent youth reported on religiosity, maternal warmth and depressive symptoms, and youth internalizing symptoms. Dyadic structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of mother and adolescent religiosity, maternal warmth, maternal depressive symptoms, and adolescent age on youth internalizing symptoms as reported by both the mother and the adolescent. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, maternal depressive symptoms were significantly associated with youth internalizing symptoms (as reported by the adolescent). Further, the impact of maternal religiosity on self-reported youth internalizing symptoms and its subscales was moderated by adolescent age. Specifically, maternal religiosity was associated with fewer self-reported internalizing symptoms in young adolescents, whereas the effect waned in older youth. Conclusions: Possible predictive coprocesses such as maternal influence on adolescent religious choices and identity formation are explored in the context of adolescent internalizing symptomatology.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate aspects of emotion dysregulation (ED) that characterize young adolescents with ADHD, examine the effects of subtype and comorbidity, and determine the extent to which ED is related to aggression and rule-breaking and social impairment. Method: We examined which aspects of ED are most relevant to ADHD in 180 young adolescents (75% boys), as well as whether ED differs across ADHD subtypes or comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) status. We also examined the association between ED and aggression, rule-breaking, and social impairment. Results: Young adolescent females and males with ADHD exhibited various manifestations of ED, including behavioral dyscontrol in the presence of strong emotions and inflexibility/slow return to emotional baseline. ED did not differ as a function of ADHD subtype or comorbid ODD. Three aspects of ED, namely, low threshold for emotional excitability/impatience, behavioral dyscontrol in the face of strong emotions, and inflexibility/slow return to baseline, predicted three of six measured indices of parent- and self-reported social impairment, above and beyond comorbid ODD. Conclusions: ED is associated with ADHD among young adolescents, does not differ based on ADHD subtype or ODD status, and is associated with social impairment.

AB The associations among socioeconomic disadvantage, amygdala volume, and internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents are unclear and understudied in the extant literature. In this study, we examined associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and amygdala volume by age across childhood and adolescence to test whether socioeconomic disadvantage would be associated with larger amygdala volume at younger ages but with smaller amygdala volume at older ages. We then examined whether SES and amygdala volume were associated with children's levels of anxiety and depression. Participants were 3- to 21-year-olds from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study (N = 1,196), which included structural magnetic resonance imaging. A subsample (n = 327; 7-21years of age) completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression. Lower family income and parental education were significantly associated with smaller amygdala volume in adolescence (13-21years) but not significantly associated with amygdala volume at younger ages (3-12years). Lower parental education, but not family income, was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, even after accounting for family history of anxiety/depression. Smaller amygdala volume was significantly associated with higher levels of depression, even after accounting for parental education and family history of anxiety/depression. These findings suggest that associations between SES and amygdala structure may vary by age. In addition, smaller amygdala volume may be linked with an increased risk for depression in children and adolescents.

AB Sleep problems in youth reliably forecast the development of anxiety and mood disorders, presumably due to increased emotional difficulties. However, precise emotional mechanisms have yet to be delineated. The current study investigated how sleep problems in adolescence are associated with different emotion regulation strategies, and how sleep and psychiatric risk may be indirectly associated via poor emotion regulation. This study utilized data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative sample from the United States (N = 10,148; age range 13-18 years). A diagnostic interview determined if adolescents qualified for a mood or anxiety disorder within the past year. Participants provided reports of their sleep, emotion regulation, and current life stress. Adolescents who reported greater sleep problems were more likely to qualify for a mood or anxiety disorder and generally reported poorer emotion regulation strategy use, even when accounting for demographic characteristics and current stress. Specifically, adolescents with greater sleep problems reported less problem solving, and greater avoidance, suppression, rumination, and acceptance. Sleep problems were indirectly associated with anxiety disorders through greater suppression and rumination, and indirectly associated with mood disorders through greater rumination and lower problem solving. Although cross-sectional, this study extends current research by suggesting that certain emotion regulation strategies may be more difficult for youth struggling with sleep problems, and provides initial evidence that poor emotion regulation may be one factor contributing to sleep-based psychiatric risk. These findings can inform more efficacious intervention efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated differences between adolescents with a depressive disorder and control subjects in their adaptive und maladaptive regulation of negative emotions. We assessed emotion regulation strategies using the German self-report questionnaire FEEL-KJ in a sample of adolescents with depression (n = 57) and controls (n = 57). We found that adolescents with depression reported using less adaptive strategies and more maladaptive strategies for dealing with the negative emotions anxiety, sadness and anger than control subjects. Our findings indicate that adolescents with depression showed difficulties with regard to different negative emotions that should be considered in intervention.

AB The concept of emotion regulation (ER) refers to the ability to perceive, assimilate, understand, and regulate emotions. Although ER is an eminently adaptive process, efforts to modify emotional states can be ineffective and even counterproductive and be part of the vulnerability and the symptoms of various mental disorders. Many research has pointed to adolescence as the most important developmental period for the acquisition of this skill. Given its importance, it is essential to have good assessment tools. The aim of this study was to determinate the psychometric properties of the "Emotion Regulation Questionnaire" (ERQ-CA) in Spanish adolescents. For this, 399 participants (178 boys and 221 girls) with a mean age of 15.27 completed the questionnaires ERQ-CA and "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale" (DERS). Subsequently, the exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency and convergent validity analysis was performed. The results revealed that the factorial analysis showed a two-factor structure, the internal consistency for the subscales was not acceptable compared to values obtained in validations with adults and as for the convergent validity, correlation between the two instruments was small. The ERQ-CA shows low levels of reliability in adolescent population. For this reason, more research is needed to confirm the use of the questionnaire in this population.

AB Background: Substance use problems are prevalent during emerging adulthood and may be particularly harmful for individuals with medical conditions. Understanding the role of positive temperament in substance use for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) may facilitate the identification of intervention and prevention targets given the complex relations between positive emotions and substance use. Objective: To examine whether components of positive temperament differentially relate to substance use in a sample of AYAs with and without medical conditions. Internalizing problems were examined as a secondary outcome given their comorbidity with substance use. Method: In a cross-sectional study that took place in 2015-2016, 494 AYAs (M-age = 19.30years, SD = 1.33, 73% female) who were enrolled in college completed online questionnaires in a laboratory regarding their levels of positive temperament (i.e., high intensity pleasure and positive affect) as well as their substance use and internalizing problems. The primary analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. Results: For healthy AYAs, high intensity pleasure was positively associated with drug and alcohol use problems and positive affect was negatively associated with drug use problems. Among AYAs with medical conditions, high intensity pleasure was positively associated with alcohol use problems. Positive affect was negatively associated with internalizing problems for both groups. Conclusions/Importance: Findings identify paths between components of temperament and substance use and internalizing problems that may inform prevention and intervention efforts tailored to the unique and overlapping needs of AYAs with a range of healthcare demands.

AB Objective: Dysfunctional and functional emotion regulation strategies in adolescence have so far been examined separately, but not in interaction. Our aim is to analyze a possible compensation of dysfunctional regulation strategies through functional strategies in depressive symptoms. Method: The Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire (REQ) was used to examine the ability of emotion regulation in 247 adolescents between 12 to 17 years (M = 14.41, SD = 1.39). To measure depressive symptoms, Allgemeine Depressionsskala (ADS) was established. Results: Results speak for a compensation of internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies with internal-functional emotion regulation strategies in girls. In boys, functional emotion regulation strategies strengthen the relationship between internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms. Other strategies do not interact with each another. Conclusions: Results indicate a compensative effect in girls, while in boys functional emotion regulation seems to have an amplifying effect on depressive symptoms. Results suggest that boys use functional strategies in a dysfunctional way, while girls are able to use them appropriately. An exploration of the understanding of functional emotion regulation may enable approaches to treatment.

AB Background: A growing body o f research suggests that the children of parents with chronic pain are at risk for internalizing symptoms. The mechanisms of such associations have not been as thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adolescents' social competence mediates the association between parental chronic pain and offspring internalizing symptoms as well as whether these associations are moderated by adolescent gender.
   Methods: The current study was based on cross-sectional data from the Nord-Tremdelag Health Study (HUNT 3), a Norwegian population-based health survey conducted in 2006-2008. The present sample comprised adolescents who had both parents participating (n=9,681). Structural equation modeling was used for the data analysis.
   Results: Our results indicated that the association between concurrent maternal and paternal chronic pain and offspring's symptoms of anxiety and depression was partly mediated by low social competence for girls (b(SE)=0.060 [0.030], P=0.043) but not for boys (b(SE)=-0.059 [0.040], P=0.146). This suggests that these associations are moderated by offspring gender.
   Conclusion: The study extends the existing literature on the possible pathways between parental chronic pain and internalizing symptoms in the offspring. Identifying protective factors in the pathways between parental chronic pain and mental distress in children could guide measures that promote the wellbeing of the child and family of chronic pain sufferers.

AB Objective: A case study describing the association between vagal tone and social-emotional adaptation in two distressed adolescent-parent (A-P) pairs during a Positive Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Programme (P-CBTP).Methods: Two A-P pairs completed a P-CBTP with pre- and post-intervention biosocial-emotional assessments; weekly training sessions over 7 weeks to develop individual strengths, new adaptive cognitions, positive discipline skills, optimism and knowledge on age-appropriate developmental expressions; augmented by moderate physical activity. Resting vagal tone and vagal reactivity were assessed by time-domain measures of vagal activity (RMSSD).Results: Social-emotional adjustment improved in all A-P pairs. Resting vagal tone increased over the intervention period, from low-to-low-normal towards average-for-normal in three subjects. The fourth individual had excessive pre-intervention resting vagal tone that declined in the direction of normal over the intervention period. Vagal reactivity in response to orthostatic stress remained the same pre- to post-intervention.Conclusions: Changes in resting vagal tone demonstrated improvements in psychological functioning in all four subjects over the period of intervention. Results supported the view of the association between vagal tone and mental health not being an absolute positive relationship, but that low, as well as excessive, vagal tone may be maladaptive. Indications are that the same may apply to vagal reactivity to psychological stress. More studies need to examine the association between resting vagal tone and emotion regulation in A-P relationships during P-CBTP, keeping in mind that a linear relationship cannot summarily be expected in population studies.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems can lead to severe restrictions in the functioning of children and to an impaired development. The types of support for children vary greatly between care providers. The aim of this study is to apply the Taxonomy of Care for Youth (TOCFY) and to make an inventory of the core elements and program elements of the various types of support for children with behavioral and emotional problems that were offered overall and per main types of providers in a delineated region. We assessed the types of support to children (N=621) by applying TOCFY. The study showed that by using Tocfy we could make an inventory of the various types of support offered. Individual child support' and family support' were provided most often, and therefore, most interventions were aimed at the child or at the child and his/her parents/caretakers. Support was mostly provided without judicial interference and within an ambulatory/outpatient or home-based setting. TOCFY could be helpful by mapping of information on the support offered to children across various types of care providers. More information on the core and program elements of these types of support may help to optimize care for children and their families.

AB Background: The concept of emotion regulation (ER) is of great importance to the field of clinical psychology and psychotherapy. However, there are only few validated instruments available to measure ER in children and adolescents. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the parent short version of the Questionnaire to Asses Children's and Adolescents' Emotion Regulation Strategies (FEEL-KJ) has enough psychometric quality to fill this gap at least in part. Additionally, to examine indicators for the validity of the instrument and its dependency on sociodemographic parameters. With increasing age, an increase in the use of ER strategies was expected. Also, positive correlations of maladaptive ER and negative correlations of adaptive ER with symptoms of psychological disorders were assumed. Method: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ and additional parent report questionnaires were used in a sample of 1,638 children aged 2-10 years (reports of both parents: n = 958 children, mothers report only: n = 605, fathers report only: n = 75). Results: Results for mothers and fathers were mostly congruent. Internal consistency values of the parent short version of the FEEL-KJ were in the range of good to very good. With increasing age, adaptive and maladaptive ER-strategies were used more frequently and correlations of ER strategies with internalizing and externalizing psychopathological symptoms were notable. Only few significant differences dependent on the sex of the child and other sociodemographic variables were found. Conclusion: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ seems to be appropriate to extend the existing assessment of ER in science and practice. However, a multimethod validation study is still necessary to further investigate the instrument's validity. Norms: The generated norms (T values and percentile ranks) are available at https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-201803050916 (Greuel, Briegel, & Heinrichs, 2018) or can be requested from the authors directly.(2)

AB In this research paper, we have studied the intermediary role of difficulties in emotion regulation in the relation between parents' emotional availability and reactive-proactive aggression in adolescents. The study has been carried out with 776 high school students (423 girls, 353 boys). Their age ranges from 14 to 19, and the age average is 16.38 (Ss=1.13). The data, in this study, have been collected by using "Reactive - Proactive Aggression Scale", "Parents' Emotional Availability Scale" and "Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale". The collected data was analysed through correlation analysis while regression analysis was used for the mediator effect and bootstrap analysis for the significance of indirect effect test. The findings of the study suggest that the reactive-proactive aggression has a positively meaningful relation with difficulties in emotion regulation, but it has a negatively meaningful relation with parents' emotional availability. According to the results of correlation and regression-based bootstrapping method, it has been determined that the difficulties in emotion regulation have a partial mediating role in the relation between parents' emotional availability and reactive-proactive aggression. We believe that the data collected during this study can be valuable sources for further studies and used for reducing the incidence of aggressive behaviours of adolescents particularly at schools.

AB Obese and overweight youth are at an increased risk for poor peer relations and psychosocial adjustment. Of particular concern is the high rate of bullying victimization experienced by obese and overweight youth. While it is known that victimized youth are at an increased risk for internalizing symptoms, few studies have examined if weight status exacerbates the association between victimization and internalizing symptoms. The current study drew upon data from over 43,000 youth attending 107 middle and high schools. Multilevel results suggested that compared with normal weight youth, both overweight and obese youth were at an increased risk for experiencing relational, verbal, and cyber victimization, with only obese youth being at an increased risk for experiencing physical victimization. Notably, the odds for experiencing cyber victimization were higher than the odds for experiencing other forms of victimization. Frequently victimized obese youth, but not frequently victimized overweight youth, had significantly higher levels of internalizing symptoms compared to their frequently victimized, normal-weight peers. Together, these findings highlight the increased risk for psychosocial adjustment problems among frequently victimized overweight and obese youth, suggesting these youth may require preventive interventions tailored to meet their unique needs.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of relationship with parents, emotion regulation, and callous-unemotional traits with Internet addiction in a community sample of adolescents. Self-report measures of relationship with parents (both mothers and fathers), emotion regulation (in its two dimensions: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), callous-unemotional traits (in its three dimensions: callousness, uncaring, and unemotional), and Internet addiction were completed by 743 adolescents aged 10 to 21 years. Results showed that a low perceived maternal availability, high cognitive reappraisal, and high callousness appeared to be predictors of Internet addiction. The implications of these findings are then discussed.

AB Purpose: Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may suffer from emotional dysregulation (ED), although this symptom is not listed among the diagnostic criteria. Methylphenidate (MPH) is useful in reducing emotional symptoms in ADHD. The aim of the present study was to determine both psychosocial risk factors and presence of ED in adolescents with ADHD before and after MPH treatment.
   Participants and methods: Eighty-two patients aged 12-18 years with ADHD were included as participants. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), sociodemographic form, and the Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury were administered. Results were compared before and after 6 months MPH treatment.
   Results: A significant improvement was detected on DERS for impulsivity (15.9 +/- 6.8 initial vs 14.2 +/- 6.5 final test, p<0.01) and total score (88.4 +/- 23.3 initial vs 82.4 +/- 2.7 final test, p<0.05) across all patients taking MPH regardless of subtype and sex. Despite treatment, a significant difference remained for impulsivity, strategies, and total score in patients with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) compared with those without ODD, but no difference was detected for conduct disorder comorbidity. In patients who self-harm, scores for goals, impulsivity, strategies, clarity, and total score were higher before treatment: furthermore, impulsivity and total score remained high after treatment. In maltreated patients, goals, impulsivity, strategies, and total scores were significantly higher before treatment; however, their symptoms were ameliorated after treatment with MPH.
   Conclusion: Individuals with severe ED may "self-medicate" by smoking and/or self-harming. MPH led to significant improvements in ED possibly owing, in part, to a decrease in impulsivity, so that individuals felt more able to supervise their emotions and engage in goal-directed behaviors. ED should be considered particularly in patients with additional psychosocial factors and ODD comorbidity, and included in the treatment plan.

AB This study examined trajectories of psychopathology in a sample of low-income urban youth and tested exposure to community violence as a predictor of these trajectories. Self-report and parent-report survey measures of psychological problems and exposure to community violence were collected annually over 3 years from a sample of 364 fifth- to ninth-grade low-income urban youth (64% female; 95% youth of color). Linear growth models showed that youth experienced declines in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Exposure to community violence was more strongly associated with externalizing symptoms than with internalizing symptoms but predicted declines in both types of symptoms. Results also indicated that youth reported more internalizing and externalizing symptoms than their parents reported for them. Exposure to community violence may explain unique trajectories of mental health problems among low-income urban youth. In addition, youth efforts to adopt a tough facade in the face of community violence could lead to higher rates of externalizing problems relative to internalizing problems, whereas desensitization processes may better explain reductions in both types of symptoms over time. Finally, youth report may be more valid than parent report in the context of urban poverty.

AB Despite increasing interest in the prevalence and correlates of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) in adolescent populations, relatively few studies have examined NSSI among lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adolescents. The current study explored sexuality concerns and elevated emotion dysregulation as potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between sexual orientation and elevated non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). A community sample of 1,799 adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing NSSI, sexual orientation, sexuality concerns, and emotion regulation. Across the study, 20.6% of adolescents reported a history of NSSI. Adolescents who identify as mostly heterosexual, bisexual, and mostly homosexual were more likely to engage in NSSI than gay/lesbian, heterosexual, and asexual adolescents. Multiple mediation analysis showed that emotion regulation, but not sexuality concerns, mediated the relationship between sexual orientation and NSSI. The current study tested two theoretical pathways by which sexual orientation could predict NSSI engagement. Findings suggest that literature on general psychological processes, as well as group-specific minority stressors, can shed light on high rates of NSSI among LGB populations. Specifically, the challenges faced by LGB adolescents may undermine the development of emotion regulation. As such, this should be a key target of intervention with LGB adolescents engaging in NSSI.

AB Internalizing disorders are common in individuals with ASD. Psychosocial interventions targeting these disorders in the ASD population have burgeoned in the last decade. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, modified for ASD, is the most frequently investigated model, although other interventions, including behaviour therapy, third-wave interventions, models targeting transdiagnostic constructs, and alternative interventions and treatment delivery methods are now emerging. This review provides a summary of the efficacy of these interventions in treating internalizing disorders in youth and adults with ASD. The barriers to accessing these treatments, which are experienced by many individuals with ASD and their families, as well as future research directions, are also discussed.

AB Although adolescents often struggle to regulate their anger, few studies have examined anger regulation within the period of adolescence. In view of this, this study explored potential sex and age differences in anger experience, expressions, and control among Grades 8-12 adolescents (n = 766) in Western Canada. Anger regulation was evaluated by the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Three separate multivariate analyses of variance and post hoc tests were performed. Results revealed that Grade 12 students experienced more anger than Grade 8 students. Furthermore, Grades 10-12 students engaged in greater levels of anger-expressive suppression compared with those in Grade 8; Grade 12 students also suppressed their anger more than Grade 9 students. Lastly, girls were less likely to control their outward anger as compared with boys. These results provide important implications for intervention efforts by suggesting nonlinear developmental patterns in anger experience and expressions as well as sex differences in anger control.

AB Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment may have devastating consequences on children's development. The aim of this research was to examine the predictive associations between exposure to violence at home (witnessing violence against the mother and/or direct victimization by the parents) and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. A total of 613 Spanish adolescents (13-18 years) took part in this study. Results indicate that psychological victimization by the parents predicted an increase in anxious/depressive symptoms, aggressive and rule-breaking behavior, and substance abuse at Time 2. In addition, rule-breaking behavior predicted an increase in adolescents' substance abuse at Time 2. Concerning gender, psychological victimization predicted an increase in anxiety/depression, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and substance abuse in boys; whereas in girls, psychological victimization only predicted an increase in anxiety/depression.

AB Objective: In our study, it's aimed to evaluate the emotion recognition and regulation skills of adolescents with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to compare the results to healthy control cases. Methods: To our study, 63 ADHD diagnosed and 32 control cases with similar sociodemographic characteristics to patient group aged 11-18 years were included. 'Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version' (K-SADS-PL) was applied to all cases in order to psychiatric evaluation. In all cases Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and Adolescent Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale (T-DSM-IV-S), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and to evaluate social cognitive properties Faces Test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), The Unexpected Outcomes Test (UOT) and Comprehension Test are applied. Results: The scores of tests evaluating emotion recognition and regulation abilities in adolescents with ADHD were lower than control group. Conclusion: The better understanding of the problems in emotion recognition and regulation abilities of the adolescents with ADHD may be helpful in determining the required interventions (social skill training etc.) in this respect.

AB Previous research has indicated that cognitive emotion regulation strategies contribute to the development and maintenance of emotional problems in adults and adolescents. However, there is a lack of longitudinal research with adolescent samples, hence knowledge of exactly how these strategies influence the development of emotional problems in adolescence is sparse. This study investigated maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation (cognitive avoidance and repetitive negative thinking) as a potential mediator in the development of anxiety and depressed mood over time in adolescence. Self-reported depressed mood, anxiety, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies were assessed during school hours in a sample of Swedish 10th graders (N=149; 53% girls), with follow-up assessments one and two years later. Repetitive negative thinking and cognitive avoidance formed a unidimensional factor of cognitive emotion regulation. Cognitive emotion regulation was found to mediate the development of both anxiety and depressed mood over time, lending support to the previous findings that cognitive emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive avoidance and repetitive negative thinking might act as transdiagnostic mechanisms in the development of emotional symptoms in adolescence. This suggests that maladaptive forms of cognitive emotion regulation could be important targets in prevention and treatment of emotional problems in adolescence.

AB Background: The relationship between psychological factors and obesity has become a hot topic in psychosomatic research. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies in Chinese adolescents with different weight status.
   Methods: Using stratified random cluster sampling, 700 and 321 adolescents were defined as adolescents with overweight status and obese status, respectively. One thousand and twenty-one adolescents with normal-weight status were also selected. All participants completed a general questionnaire and Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.
   Results: Adolescents in the obesity group obtained the highest scores on self-blame and rumination in three groups, and those from the obesity group obtained lower scores on acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal than those from normal group (ps<0.05). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a significant impact on BMI, accounting for 32.0% variance (p<0.001). Higher scores on self-blame and rumination were associated with higher BMI, but greater acceptance and positive refocusing were associated with lower BMI (ps<0.05).
   Conclusion: Self-blame, rumination, acceptance, and positive refocusing have considerable effects on BMI in Chinese adolescents. The causal relationship of CER strategies and BMI should be explained more accurately and thoroughly to prevent and intervene in cases of adolescent obesity.

AB Few studies have examined the effectiveness of outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in routine care settings for children and adolescents with mental disorders. This observational study examined changes in behavioral and emotional problems of adolescents with mental disorders during routine outpatient CBT delivered at a university outpatient clinic and compared them with a historical control group of youths who received academic tutoring of comparable length and intensity. Assessments were made at the start and end of treatment (pre- and post-assessment) using parent ratings of the German versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and self-ratings of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) scale. For the main analysis, 677 adolescents aged 11aEuro'21 years had complete data. Changes from pre- to post-assessment showed significant reductions in mental health problems on both parent- and self-ratings. Pre- to post-effect sizes (Cohen's d) were small-to-medium for the total sample (d = 0.23 to d = 0.62) and medium-to-large for those adolescents rated in the clinical range on each (sub)scale at the start of treatment (d = 0.65 to d = 1.48). We obtained medium net effect sizes (d = 0.69) for the CBCL and YSR total scores when patients in the clinical range were compared to historical controls. However, a substantial part of the sample remained in the clinical range at treatment end. The results suggest that CBT is effective for adolescents with mental disorders when administered under routine care conditions but must be interpreted conservatively due to the lack of a direct control condition.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the inter-relationship between emotion regulation (ER), intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents and young adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sixty-one individuals aged 14-24 years (M (age) = 18.19; SD (age) = 2.19) completed the ER Questionnaire, IU Scale-12, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Dimensional Anxiety Scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Autism-Spectrum Quotient-Short. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results indicated all key variables were associated with each other and IU mediated the relationships between ER and symptoms of anxiety and of depression. Findings have implications for the design of future interventions targeting affective disorders in ASD.

AB Objective: A considerable number of adolescents exhibit severe self-regulation deficits in affect and behavior, which are referred to as affective dysregulation (AD). AD may be conceptualized as a dimensional trait that, in its extreme form, resembles the diagnostic categories of severe mood dysregulation (SMD) or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Assuming a shared pathway of psychopathology in AD and SMD, similar underlying dysfunctional mechanisms in emotion processing, particularly emotion recognition (RECOG) and regulation (REGUL), may be postulated. Method: Adolescent inpatients with AD (CAD, N = 35), without AD (CCG, N = 28), and nonclinical controls (NCG; N = 28) were administered a morphed facial recognition task (RECOG). REGUL abilities, levels of irritability as well as depressive symptoms were also assessed. Results: We found no significant group differences in accuracy and thresholds for RECOG abilities. Patients with AD reported more dysfunctional REGUL strategies than did CCG and NCG. Both depression and AD, but not irritability, influenced the overall degree of maladaptive REGUL. Conclusion: The broad phenotype of AD does not involve the deficits in RECOG reported for adolescents with a narrow phenotype (SMD); regarding REGUL strategies, AD seems to be associated with specific impairments.

AB In adolescence, when establishing and maintaining satisfying social relationships is a key developmental task, chronic loneliness is related to a host of negative outcomes. This study aimed at examining motivational and regulatory factors related to chronic loneliness. Specifically, this study investigated chronically lonely adolescents' responses to hypothetical vignettes of social inclusion and exclusion, thereby focusing on (a) adolescents' willingness and motivation to approach social inclusion and (b) emotion regulation strategies to deal with social exclusion. A total of 730 adolescents (Mage = 15.43 years, 72% female) participated in this four-wave study with annual loneliness assessments and hypothetical vignettes of social inclusion and exclusion at the final wave. After each social inclusion vignette, participants rated their willingness to accept the invitation for social inclusion and five types of motivation to approach the situation. After each social exclusion vignette, participants rated nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Compared to individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were less likely to accept invitations for social inclusion and the quality of their motivation for accepting such invitations was lower. Further, they were more likely to employ maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. In sum, this study adds significantly to understanding the motivational and regulatory processes that differentiate chronically lonely adolescents from adolescents following other trajectories.

AB The association between cognitive emotion regulation strategy use and adolescents' risk behavior has long been emphasized. To identify coping profiles of Chinese adolescents having unprotected sex and to examine the characteristics and associations among those subgroups, 541 adolescents (age, 14-19 years) were screened from secondary schools in 10 Chinese cities. By latent profile analysis (LPA), the participants were identified into three latent profiles: the low reaction profile (LRP, N = 70), the medium reaction profile (MRP, N = 369), and the high reaction profile (HRP, N = 102) based on nine subscales of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). By one-way analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that: the HRP has the highest level of using eight strategies and the lowest unprotected sex, meanwhile the LRP has the lowest level of using nine strategies and the highest unprotected sex among three groups (both p < .05). The low response coping was more prevalent among boys and younger students. It indicates that more active cognitive coping, using both adaptive and maladaptive strategies, may associate with less unprotected sex. The programs of enhancing active copying may be targeted in interventions aiming to reduce adolescent unprotected sex.

AB Background: The possibility of using biological measures to predict the trajectory of symptoms among adolescent psychiatric inpatients has important implications. This study aimed to examine emotion regulation ability (measured via self-report) and a hypothesized proxy in resting-state functional connectivity [RSFC] between the amygdala and frontal brain regions as baseline predictors of internalizing symptom recovery during inpatient care.
   Methods: 196 adolescents (61% female; Mage = 15.20; SD = 1.48) completed the Achenbach Brief Problem Monitor (BPM) each week during their inpatient care. RSFC (n = 45) and self-report data of emotion regulation (n = 196) were collected at baseline.
   Results: The average internalizing symptom score at admission was high (alpha(0) = 66.52), exceeding the BPM's clinical cut off score of 65. On average, internalizing symptom scores declined significantly, by 0.40 points per week (p = 0.004). While self-reported emotion regulation was associated with admission levels of internalizing problems, it did not predict change in symptoms. RSFC between left amygdala and left superior frontal gyrus was significantly associated with the intercept-higher connectivity was associated with higher internalizing at admission-and the slope-higher connectivity was associated with a more positive slope (i.e., less decline in symptoms). RSFC between the right amygdala and the left superior frontal gyrus was significantly, positively correlated with the slope parameter.
   Conclusions: Results indicate the potential of biologically-based measures that can be developed further for personalized care in adolescent psychiatry.

AB Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach.
   Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted.
   Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = -0.73; 95% CI [-1.42;-0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions (n = 100) compared to different control group interventions (n = 95).
   Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious health risk behavior that forms the basis of a tentative diagnosis in DSM-5, NSSI Disorder (NSSID). To date, established treatments specific to NSSI or NSSID are scarce. As a first step in evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a novel treatment for adolescents with NSSID, we conducted an open trial of emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA): a 12-week, behavioral treatment aimed at directly targeting both NSSI and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion regulation difficulties.
   Methods: Seventeen girls (aged 13-17; mean = 15.31) with NSSID were enrolled in a study adopting an uncontrolled open trial design with self-report and clinician-rated assessments of NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors, emotion regulation difficulties, borderline personality features, and global functioning administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Measures of NSSI and emotion regulation difficulties were also administered weekly during treatment.
   Results: Ratings of treatment credibility and expectancy and the treatment completion rate (88%) were satisfactory, and both therapeutic alliance and treatment attendance were strong. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant improvements associated with large effect sizes in past-month NSSI frequency, emotion regulation difficulties, self-destructive behaviors, and global functioning, as well as a medium effect size in past-month NSSI versatility, from pre- to post-treatment. Further, all of these improvements were either maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Finally, change in emotion regulation difficulties mediated improvements in NSSI over the course of treatment.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of this treatment for adolescents with NSSID.

AB This study uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with smartphone devices to examine community adolescents' perceptions regarding both the intensity of and variability in their daily sadness/depression, anxiety, and somatic problems over the period of one week. Participants were 90 high-school students (M-age = 14.61, SD = 1.64; range 12-18). The sample was divided according to gender (61.1% girls), migratory status (68.5% Spanish nationals and 31.5% Latin American immigrants), and level of psychological symptoms (17% risk group). Sadness/depression, anxiety, and somatic problems were examined using a smartphone app, five times per day, semi-randomly, for seven days (35 possible moments). A high proportion of adolescents did not report feelings of sadness (80.0%) or worry (79.3%) or physical symptoms on a daily basis (84.9%). Girls and the risk group reported greater intensity levels for the three analyzed problems than did boys and the normal group, respectively (p < .001 in all cases). Migratory status was not associated with any significant differences in the analyzed problems over the one-week period (p > .05 in all cases). Day-to-day fluctuations in mood during the week were statistically significant but not meaningful (b = 0.0004, 95% CI [0.0001, 0.0008], p = .001).

AB The present study tested the role of FKBP5 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) genetic variation in an internalizing pathway from child maltreatment to emerging adult problem drinking among a sample of African American youth (N = 280) followed prospectively from ages 11 to 20. Specifically, whether childhood internalizing symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol expectancies sequentially mediate the effect of child maltreatment on emerging adult problem drinking and whether FKBP5 moderates these associations were investigated. The results indicate that individuals with at least one copy of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype (minor alleles) are more vulnerable to traversing the hypothesized internalizing pathway of risk than individuals without this genotypic profile. Taken together our findings highlight the importance of FKBP5 genetic variation in the context of early adversity; support the role of two prospective sequential mediators of an internalizing pathway to problematic drinking, namely, childhood internalizing symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol expectancies; and identify a subgroup of maltreated children most susceptible to progressing along this less common pathway of risk.

AB BackgroundAs predicted by self-medication theories that drinking is motivated by a desire to ameliorate emotional distress, some studies find internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) increase risk of adolescent drinking; however, such a risk effect has not been supported consistently. Our prior work examined externalizing symptoms as a potential moderator of the association between internalizing symptoms and adolescent alcohol use to explain some of the inconsistencies in the literature. We found that internalizing symptoms were protective against early adolescent alcohol use particularly for youth elevated on externalizing symptoms (a 2-way interaction). Our sample has now been followed for several additional assessments that extend into young adulthood, and the current study tests whether the protective effect of internalizing symptoms may change as youth age into young adulthood, and whether this age-moderating effect varied across different clusters of internalizing symptoms (social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression). Internalizing symptoms were hypothesized to shift from a protective factor to a risk factor with age, particularly for youth elevated on externalizing symptoms.
   MethodsA community sample of 387 adolescents was followed for 9 annual assessments (mean age=12.1years at the first assessment and 55% female). Multilevel cross-lagged 2-part zero-inflated Poisson models were used to test hypotheses.
   ResultsThe most robust moderating effects were for levels of alcohol use, such that the protective effect of all internalizing symptom clusters was most evident in the context of moderate to high levels of externalizing problems. A risk effect of internalizing symptoms was evident at low levels of externalizing symptoms. With age, the risk and protective effects of internalizing symptoms were evident at less extreme levels of externalizing behavior. With respect to alcohol-related problems, findings did not support age moderation for generalized anxiety or depression, but it was supported for social anxiety.
   ConclusionsFindings highlight the importance of considering the role of emotional distress from a developmental perspective and in the context of externalizing behavior problems.

AB This study examined whether measures of children's autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to social stress moderated the effect of parent emotion socialization on children's social and emotional adjustment. Sixty-one children (9-13 years) completed a peer rejection task while their respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSA-R) and skin conductance level reactivity (SCL-R) were assessed. Parents' report of supportive and non-supportive reactions to their child's negative emotions served as measures of emotion socialization. Measures of children's social and emotional adjustment included: teacher-rated peer rejection, aggression, and prosocial behavior and parent-rated aggressive/dysregulated behavior and emotion regulation skills. Measures of children's ANS reactivity moderated the effect of parent emotion socialization on children's adjustment. Supportive responses were more protective for children evidencing RSA augmentation whereas non-supportive responses were more detrimental for children evidencing low SCL-R. Thus children's ANS reactivity during social stress may represent a biological vulnerability that influences sensitivity to parent emotion socialization.

AB BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions improve a variety of clinical outcomes. Executive functioning (EF) and emotion dysregulation are among the proposed transdiagnostic mechanisms that such interventions are proposed to target. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of mindfulness meditation training on EF and emotion dysregulation in a sample of female adolescents with elevations in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms against a waitlist control condition.
   MethodThis study adopted a mixed 2 (treatment group, waitlist control group)x2 (pre-test, post-test) design. Adolescent females (13-15 years old) exhibiting elevations in ADHD symptoms according to multiple informants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness treatment group (n=15) or a waitlist control group (n=15).
   ResultsAmong EF laboratory tasks, planning and inhibition were higher in the treatment group relative to the control group with large effect sizes at post-treatment. The treatment group also exhibited lower scores in self-reported emotion dysregulation (total, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and impulse control difficulties) in comparison to the waitlist control group with large effect sizes at post-treatment. Within group pre-test and post-test comparisons indicated improvement on particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation only for the treatment group.
   ConclusionsMindfulness meditation training improved particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation in adolescent females with elevations in ADHD symptoms. Treatment development efforts should target clinical populations that exhibit difficulties in these transdiagnostic mechanisms.

AB This study examined the mediating role of child emotional dysregulation in the association between harsh parenting and Chinese adolescent problematic Internet use (PIU) and the moderating role of child forgiveness on this indirect association. Eight hundred and twenty eight middle school students with their parents were recruited as voluntary participants. Parents were required to report on their spouses' harsh parenting. And students were asked to report on their emotional dysregulation, tendency to forgive and their level of PIU. The results demonstrated that beyond the direct impact of harsh parenting on adolescent PIU, harsh parenting also indirectly contributed to adolescent PIU via the mediator of adolescents' emotional dysregulation. More importantly, we found that child forgiveness moderated the indirect relation of harsh parenting to adolescent PIU via child emotional dysregulation, with harsh parenting indirectly impacting PIU for only those adolescents with low levels of forgiveness. These results add to the current theoretical basis for preventing or intervening in the negative impact of negative parenting on adolescent PIU by ameliorating parental disciplinary strategies and/or fostering adolescent forgiveness toward parents who unjustly hurt them.

AB The social-emotional functions associated with Machiavellianism have been widely examined. However, most research on Machiavellianism is cross-sectional design, and has been conducted in adult populations. Using a sample of adolescents (n = 454), the current study employed a longitudinal design to examine how Machiavellianism relates to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The results indicated that (a) a significant increase in Machiavellianism scores and a significant decrease in difficulties scores were observed over the course of a year; (b) Machiavellianism shows significant positive associations, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, with nearly all categories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems; (c) time 1 hyperactivity was a significant predictor of time 2 (one year later) Machiavellianism; and (d) over the course of a year, Machiavellian ism still has a significant impact on subsequent conduct problems. The implications of these findings are interpreted and discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Earlier research has identified a remarkable number of related factors to resilience during adolescence. Historically, theoretical treatments of resilience have been focused almost exclusively on psychosocial levels of analysis to derive explanatory models. However, there is insufficient understanding of the role of emotion regulation explaining competent functioning despite the experience of adversity (resilience), especially during adolescence. This study explores the relationship between both, emotional regulation abilities and strategies, and resilience in a sample of adolescents from suburbs high-schools (Jerez de la Frontera, Spain). The study also examines how using different emotional regulation strategies may help the development of resilience levels at this stage. Participants of the study were 164 adolescents ranging from 13 to 16 years old (M = 13.98; SD = 0.66). Emotion regulation was measured using the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ, Garnefski et al., 2001), and sections D and H of Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, a performance test (Emotion Regulation Ability sections, MSCEIT, Spanish version, Mayer et al., 2003). Resilience was evaluated with ERE (Educative Resilience Scale for children and adolescents, Saavedra and Castro, 2009). Verbal Intelligence (Yuste, 1997) and personality traits (Cattell and Cattell, 1986) were assessed as two independent variables. Results supported the idea that emotion regulation ability (MSCEIT, D and H sections, Extremera et al., 2006) is a significant predictor of adolescents' resilience. Moreover, cognitive regulation strategies, such as positive reappraisal, predicted perceived resilience among students. Sociability (A factor of HSPQ, sociability) also correlated with resilience levels. Hence, these results are promising, implying that emotion regulation ability may act as a helpful tool preventing adolescents from irrational risky behaviors, commonly assumed at this developmental stage.

AB Background: The co-occurrence of alcohol use and externalizing/internalizing problems threatens adolescents' mental health. Research on whether alcohol use and these problems are causal and the direction of the potential causal relationships is needed to understand the mechanisms of the co-occurrence.
   Methods: A Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted in which the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 polymorphism was used as an instrumental variable for alcohol use phenotypes. In total, 1,608 Chinese adolescents (mean age 14.11 +/- 1.83 years) were genotyped for the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism. Three externalizing problems (aggression, delinquency, and attention problems) were measured with the Youth Self-Report inventory, and 2 internalizing problems (depression and anxiety) were measured with the self-reported Children's Depression Inventory and the Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.
   Results: Alcohol use was positively associated with all 3 externalizing and 2 internalizing problems, and the ALDH2 polymorphism had a significant effect on alcohol use. Aggression and attention problems were also significantly affected by the ALDH2 polymorphism, whereas no significant association was observed between the ALDH2 polymorphism and delinquency, anxiety, or depression.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that alcohol use is a cause of adolescent aggression and attention problems but not adolescent delinquency, anxiety, or depression.

AB There is substantial evidence that personality traits, such as self-criticism and dependency, predict the development of depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as depressive episodes. However, it is unknown whether self-criticism and dependency predict the first onset of depressive and anxiety disorders, and unclear how to characterize dynamic mechanisms by which these traits, stressful life events, and psychopathology influence one another over time. In this study, 550 female adolescents were assessed at baseline, 528 and 513 of whom were assessed again at Waves 2 and 3, respectively, over the course of 18 months. Self-criticism and dependency were assessed with self-report inventories, depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed with diagnostic interviews, and stressful life events were assessed via semistructured interview. Logistic regression analyses showed that self-criticism and dependency significantly predicted the first onset of nearly all depressive and anxiety disorders (significant polychoric rs ranged from .15-.42). Subsequent path analyses focused on prediction of depression, and supported several conceptual models of personality-stress-psychopathology relationships. In particular, Personality x Stress interactions were evident for both dependency and self-criticism. These interactions took the form of dual vulnerability, such that stressful life events predicted an increased probability of a later depressive disorder only at low levels of each trait. Results suggest the traits of self-criticism and dependency are important to consider in understanding who is at risk for depressive and anxiety disorders.

AB Migrant youth face cultural challenges upon initial adjustment into the United States. Although there is considerable empirical evidence that trauma impacts interpersonal relations, there is a dearth of research examining the association between adverse events and the initial social and cultural exchange experience, and whether this is associated with psychological adjustment. This study examined self-report data for 87 newly arrived migrant-origin students in Grades 5-10 from Latin American, Caribbean, Asian, and African backgrounds attending a public alternative school in the Southeastern United States. Data were collected as part of a community-based partnership. The relation between cumulative trauma exposure and internalizing symptoms was fully mediated by acculturative stress (p < .05), suggesting prior trauma exposure negatively affected these students' capacity to navigate a new cultural milieu, which in turn is directly associated with internalizing symptoms. Behavioral health care practitioners can use screening procedures early in the academic year to detect which migrant students may be experiencing difficult cultural transitions.

AB Mounting research supports that co-rumination, the tendency to seek peer support by engaging in extensive negatively focused discussion, is a risk factor for adolescent psychopathology. It is unclear, though, how this interpersonal tendency develops. Parental responses to adolescents' negative affect likely shape how youth utilize peer relationships to regulate distress, as they shift to reliance on peer support during this developmental stage. For example, nonsupportive parental responses may fail to instill healthy regulation strategies, resulting in ineffective forms of peer support, such as co-rumination. Conversely, high levels of supportive parental responses to adolescents' negative affect may motivate youth to also express more negative affect with peers, leading to co-rumination. Eighty-nine healthy adolescents (9-17) and their mothers completed surveys and a support-seeking interaction. Only supportive maternal responses, including maternal affection, were associated with adolescents' co-rumination. These analyses indicate that some forms of parental support are associated with adolescents' tendency to co-ruminate.

TI Disrupted amygdala-prefrontal connectivity during emotion regulation

AB Rumination in response to stress (stress-reactive rumination) has been linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms in adolescents. However, no work to date has examined the neural mechanisms connecting stress-reactive rumination and adolescent depressive symptoms. The present work attempted to bridge this gap through an fMRI study of 41 adolescent girls (M-age = 15.42, SD = 0.33) - a population in whom elevated levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, and social stress sensitivity are displayed. During the scan, participants completed two tasks: an emotion regulation task and a social stress task. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we found that positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the emotion regulation task mediated the association between stress-reactive rumination and depressive symptoms. These results suggest that stress-reactive rumination may interfere with the expression and development of neural connectivity patterns associated with effective emotion regulation, which may contribute, in turn, to heightened depressive symptoms.

AB The aims of the present study were (a) to examine whether Dutch and Indian early adolescents differ concerning sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems, and (b) to compare the associations between sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems for Indian and Dutch early adolescents. Our sample consisted of 274 Dutch (mean age = 10.9 years) and 236 Indian early adolescents (mean age = 10.8 years). Questionnaires were administered in the final grades of 15 Dutch primary schools and six Indian English-language middle schools. Indian early adolescents reported more sibling warmth and parental negative interaction than Dutch early adolescents. However, associations between sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems were similar. Our study indicates that cross-cultural differences may exist in quality of sibling and parent-child relationships, but not in their impact on externalizing and internalizing problems. More cross-cultural research concerning family relationship quality and its impact on early adolescent psychosocial development is needed to confirm our findings.

AB Aims: The use of emotion regulation strategies can reduce the intensity of negative emotional experiences. Event related potentials (ERPs), specifically the late positive potential (LPP), are known to be sensitive to this modulation in adults. This is the first study to explore the neural correlates of expressive suppression in adolescents. We sought to replicate previous findings from emotion regulation studies with adult populations, show that the LPP can be modulated by expressive suppression in healthy adolescents, and examine the influence of age on LPP changes.
   Method: ERPs of 53 healthy adolescents (12-17 years old) performing an emotion regulation task (expressive suppression) were recorded.
   Results: Expressive suppression altered the LPP in adolescents with both increases and decreases noted depending on time window and recording site. The LPP during expressive suppression was decreased with increasing age.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that 1) the LPP is an effective tool to study processes associated with emotion regulation in adolescents, and 2) expressive suppression, in terms of its neural indicators, seems to become more effective with age. The nature and utility of expressive suppression as a specific form of emotion regulation in adolescents are discussed.

AB This study validated a Chinese adaptation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CCA), a self-report instrument that evaluates two emotion regulation (ER) strategies, based on the process model of ER. The ERQ-CCA was evaluated using a sample of 1381 Chinese children aged between 7 and 12 years. The internal consistencies of the two factors indicated adequate reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed good support as the structure proved to be identical with that of the original instrument. Multigroup CFA supported an invariant factor solution of the ERQ-CCA across several demographic variations (gender, age, registered permanent residence and migrant status) in different groups. Test-retest correlations over a 2-month period were calculated using a subsample of children (N = 70). Convergent validity was evaluated in relation to the model dimensions of the ERQ-CCA, Chinese version of the Children'sDepression Inventory, and Chinese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents. Results indicated that the ERQ-CCA has generally satisfactory reliability and validity in investigating the use of two ER strategies during the middle childhood developmental period.

AB Objective: Using diary and longitudinal data, the current study examined the relations between Mexican-origin youths' ethnic discrimination, daily sleep and stress processes, and internalizing symptoms. Method: Adolescents (N = 113; 49.6% female, M-age = 15.73 years) participated in an initial in-home interview and reported on ethnic discrimination and internalizing symptoms. They then completed a 3-day diary study and reported on their daily stress and sleep behaviors (i.e., sleep quality, sleep duration). Adolescents' internalizing symptoms were reassessed 2 years after the initial assessment. Results: Discrimination related to greater daily stress and lower sleep quality. Daily stress was, in turn, marginally related to concurrent internalizing symptoms, but not longitudinal changes in symptoms. Sleep duration was unrelated to discrimination experiences and concurrent and long-term internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Discrimination disrupts daily processes that include overall stress levels and sleep quality. Daily stress processes may help explain the link between discrimination and Mexican-origin adolescents' concurrent internalizing symptoms. Research examining daily processes provides insight into psychological and behavioral implications of discrimination experiences of adolescents.

AB Clinical assessment of anxiety in adolescents often involves multiple informants, and parental internalizing symptoms have been found to influence parent ratings of adolescents' anxiety symptoms. We investigated how parental internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) were related to adolescent and parent reports of adolescents' anxiety symptoms in a population-based cross-sectional survey. The sample comprised 337 adolescent-mother-father triads (N = 1,011) drawn from the Tracking Opportunities and Problems in Childhood and Adolescence (TOPP) study. Adolescents (43.9% boys) were 4- and 15-years old. Adolescent and parent ratings of adolescent anxiety symptoms (The Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory for Children) were moderately and significantly correlated (mother-adolescent r = .30; father-adolescent r = .25). Parents also self-rated internalizing symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25). Regression models showed higher maternal and paternal depression symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms, were associated with higher parent-rated adolescent anxiety symptoms. Higher maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as paternal depression symptoms, but not paternal anxiety symptoms, were associated with lower parent-adolescent agreement on adolescent anxiety symptoms (i.e., parent-rating higher relative to adolescent-rating). When adolescents rate considerably lower anxiety compared with how their parents rate them, considering parental depression as a possible reason may be key to understanding adolescents' treatment needs.

AB The main aim of the current study was to test the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis across internalizing and externalizing problems in Chinese adolescents. The participants consisted of 2,158 adolescents aged 11-19 years from three middle schools, and they completed a number of measures assessing a wide range of automatic thoughts and syndromes related to internalizing and externalizing problems. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that thoughts about social threats, personal failure and hostility were the strongest predictors of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems, respectively. Age was a statistically significant, albeit modest, moderator of the relationship between automatic thoughts about social threat and anxiety. The current study provides support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis in internalizing and externalizing problems in a Chinese sample.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) was introduced in 1980s in the field of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies indicate that symptoms of SCT are separate from symptoms of ADHD and independently associated with multiple domains of functioning in clinical groups and in typical development. We assessed whether similar pattern would apply to higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Children with higher functioning ASD (N = 55; 5-15 years) were divided into the ASD+High SCT (n = 17), the ASD+Medium SCT (n = 18) and the ASD+Low SCT (n = 20) groups based on parent-rated daydreaming and slowness on the Five to Fifteen questionnaire (FTF). The groups were compared on SCT-related impairments found in previous studies: social skills, academic functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and processing speed. Assessment methods were the FTF, the Development and Well-Being Assessment, and the Coding subtest of the WISC-III. The ADHD symptoms were statistically controlled due to the overlap between SCT and ADHD. The ASD+High SCT and ASD+Medium SCT groups were significantly more likely to have the most pronounced social impairments, and the ASD+High SCT group had significantly higher rate of internalizing disorders compared to the ASD+Low SCT group. Our results suggest that children with higher functioning ASD and high or medium levels of SCT symptoms could be at higher risk for psychosocial impairments than children with higher functioning ASD with low levels of SCT symptoms. Co-occurring ADHD symptoms do not explain the finding. Recognizing SCT symptoms in higher functioning ASD would be important to targeting preventive support.

AB This study used four waves of data from a longitudinal study of 749 Mexican origin youths to test a developmental cascades model linking contextual adversity in the family and peer domains in late childhood to a sequence of unfolding processes hypothesized to predict problem substance use and risky sexual activity (greater number of sex partners) in late adolescence. Externalizing and internalizing problems were tested as divergent pathways, with youth-reported and mother-reported symptoms examined in separate models. Youth gender, nativity, and cultural orientation were tested as moderators. Family risk, peer social rejection, and their interaction were prospectively related to externalizing symptoms and deviant peer involvement, although family risk showed stronger effects on parent-reported externalizing and peer social rejection showed stronger effects on youth-reported externalizing. Externalizing symptoms and deviant peers were related, in turn, to risk taking in late adolescence, including problem alcohol-substance use and number of sexual partners. Peer social rejection predicted youth-reported internalizing symptoms, and internalizing was related, in turn, to problem alcohol and substance use in late adolescence. Tests of moderation showed some of these developmental cascades were stronger for adolescents who were female, less oriented to mainstream cultural values, and more oriented to Mexican American cultural values.

AB The current study examines the relation between distress tolerance, perceived stress, and internalizing symptoms across adolescence. Participants included 331 youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5 years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions, including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand the emergence of internalizing symptomology.

AB Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as rumination and catastrophizing, are transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology. PK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) has been found to moderate the relationship between stressful life events and various psychiatric disorders. Given the cross-disorder moderation effect of FKBP5 at the diagnostic level, the aim of the current study was to examine whether the relationship between exposure to childhood trauma and transdiagnostic maladaptive emotion regulation processes would also be moderated by genetic FKBP5 variation in a community sample of adolescents, We hypothesized that adolescent carriers of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype composed of rs9296158, rs3800373, rs1360780, and rs9470080, that has been associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders in adulthood, would also show higher levels of rumination and catastrophizing. Participants included 1345 genotyped adolescents (M-age = 13.95, 64.2% female; 100% European Caucasians of Portuguese descent) who completed self-report measures on exposure to childhood trauma and emotion regulation strategies. Genotypes of rs9296158, rs3800373, rs1360780, and rs9470080 were used to estimate the CATT haplotype (carriers versus non-carriers). Consistent with our hypotheses and previous findings, adolescent CATT haplotype carriers with higher levels of childhood trauma endorsed higher levels of both rumination and catastrophizing compared to non-carriers. Given the association of these maladaptive emotion regulation processes and psychiatric disorders, the findings suggest possible psychological mechanisms why FKBP5 haplotype carriers exposed to childhood trauma are more vulnerable to developing a psychiatric disorder later in life.

AB This study examines possible bidirectional relationships between emotion regulation and motives related to consuming palatable foods during adolescence. Participants included 79 adolescents (96% African American) who took part in Waves 2 and 3 of the Coping with Violence Study. The youth were recruited from four public middle schools serving low income, urban communities in Birmingham, AL. Participants completed self-report measures of emotion regulation and indicated different motives for consuming tasty foods and drinks at both waves. Results demonstrate that poorer emotion regulation at Wave 2 predicted more frequent endorsement of eating motives related to coping and conforming at Wave 3. Eating motives at Wave 2 were not associated with changes in emotion regulation at Wave 3. The results suggest that emotion regulation problems in adolescence may contribute to obesity and related negative outcomes through greater consumption of unhealthy food for coping and social conformity reasons.

AB Adolescent suicide is a global public health problem. Currently, most suicide prevention and treatment programs rely heavily on youth self-report in order to determine adolescent suicide risk. Parents may be useful informants, however, as there are times when parents are more likely to report suicidality than youth, particularly when youth display externalizing symptomatology, such as aggression and delinquency. This study compared parent-adolescent suicide report concordance among adolescents with internalizing versus externalizing symptoms and examined whether internalizing or externalizing youth were more or less likely than parents to report adolescent suicidal ideation. Using data from a subsample of adolescents recruited from inpatient and partial hospitalization programs for a separate study (n = 64), a one-sized z-test for proportions was used to compare parent-adolescent suicide report concordance for subsamples of adolescents with internalizing versus externalizing symptomatology. Two-sided z-tests for proportions were used to compare the proportions of parents and adolescents reporting adolescent suicidal ideation for discordant pairs in each subset. There were no statistically significant discrepancies in reports of suicidal ideation for the internalizing and externalizing subsets, nor were adolescents significantly more likely than parents to report adolescent suicidal ideation. Among the discordant pairs in the externalizing subset, the proportion of parents who reported that their adolescents had expressed suicidal ideation (60%) was higher than the proportion of adolescents who actually reported experiencing suicidal ideation (40%), though this difference was not statistically significant. For internalizing adolescents, the proportion of parents who reported their children had expressed suicidal ideation (63.0%) was significantly smaller than the proportion of adolescents who reported experiencing suicidal ideation (81.5%; p<.05). The clinical implications of these preliminary findings point to the importance of including parents in the process of assessing suicidality in order to help them recognize warning signs in their children.

AB Growing up in a White family does not necessarily protect internationally adopted Korean Americans raised in White families from the pernicious effects of discrimination. Emotion regulation strategies may buffer the effects of discrimination on psychological adjustment, yet little research has been conducted on these links. To fill this gap, we examined the relationship between emotion regulation, discrimination and psychological adjustment in a sample of adopted Korean American adolescents (N = 115). Using both parent and adopted child reports across 2 waves of data (7 years apart), we addressed 2 questions. First, what are the different emotion regulation profiles and how do they correspond to psychological adjustment? Second, controlling for adjustment in childhood, do these emotion regulation profiles moderate the association between discrimination and psychological adjustment? We found 3 distinct profiles using cluster analysis: high reappraisal/low suppression (HR/LS), high reappraisal/moderate suppression (HR/MS), and moderate reappraisal/moderate suppression (MR/MS). The HR/LS profile showed the best adjustment, whereas the MR/MS profile reported the most adjustment problems. However, emotion regulation profiles did not moderate the association between perceived discrimination and psychological adjustment.

AB Empathy plays a key role in maintaining close relationships and promoting prosocial conflict resolution. However, research has not addressed the potential emotional cost of adolescents' high empathy, particularly when relationships are characterized by more frequent conflict. The present 6-year longitudinal study (N = 467) investigated whether conflict with parents predicted emotion dysregulation more strongly for high-empathy adolescents than for lower-empathy adolescents. Emotion dysregulation was operationalized at both the experiential level, using mood diary data collected for 3 weeks each year, and at the dispositional level, using annual self-report measures. In line with predictions, we found that more frequent adolescent-parent conflict predicted greater day-to-day mood variability and dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation for high-empathy adolescents, but not for average-and low-empathy adolescents. Mood variability and difficulties in emotion regulation, in turn, also predicted increased conflict with parents. These links were not moderated by empathy. Moreover, our research allowed for a novel investigation of the interplay between experiential and dispositional emotion dysregulation. Day-to-day mood variability predicted increasing dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation over time, which suggests that experiential dysregulation becomes consolidated into dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that, for high-empathy adolescents, conflict was a driver of this dysregulation consolidation process. Finally, emotion dysregulation played a role in overtime conflict maintenance for high-empathy adolescents. This suggests that, through emotion dysregulation, high empathy may paradoxically also contribute to maintaining negative adolescent-parent interactions. Our research indicates that high empathy comes at a cost when adolescent-parent relationships are characterized by greater negativity.

AB Unwarranted friendship jealousy can create friendship and broader peer difficulties for adolescents. This study expands earlier research-on the role of self-esteem in friendship jealousy by considering emotion regulation skill and parental use of psychological control as intersecting factors. 72 young adolescents completed questionnaires on themselves, their friendships, and their family experiences. As predicted, poor self-esteem related to friendship jealousy but only when adolescents were poorly-equipped to deal with strong emotions. Adolescents from homes with psychologically-controlling mothers were also prone to jealousy, evidently because psychological control and broader warmth in the relationship compromised offspring's self-esteem. One consequence of psychological control for offspring may be friendship difficulties related to insecurity over a partner's commitment and exaggeration of the risk posed by rivals.

AB Adolescents with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) exhibit symptoms of slowness, mental confusion, excessive daydreaming, low motivation, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Although many symptoms of SCT reflect internalizing states, no study has evaluated the clinical utility of self-report of SCT in an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) sample. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether SCT is best conceptualized as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. In a sample of 262 adolescents comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD, the present study used adolescent- and parent reports of SCT to evaluate the predictive utility of a general SCT factor from a bifactor modeling approach compared the utility of three specific SCT factors (slow, sleepy, and daydreamer) for predicting academic impairment and internalizing psychopathology. Overall, a multidimensional framework of SCT was supported, with the three SCT factors differentially predicting impairment and in one case (school grades), predicting impairment when the general factor did not. Consistent with prior research, SCT slow behaviors appear to be most strongly associated with impairment, predicting both academic impairment and internalizing psychopathology. Parent report of SCT was most useful for predicting academic functioning, whereas youth self-report was important for predicting anxiety and depression. Implications of the findings for the assessment and potential treatment of SCT are discussed.

AB This study examined a university-community partnership, focusing on mental health promotion within an after-school music program. We pursued two goals: (a) supporting staff around student engagement and behavior management; (b) integrating social-emotional activities into the curriculum. We assessed youth's mental health needs and examined feasibility of social-emotional activities delivered. One-hundred sixty-two youth participated in activities, while a subset of youth (n = 61) and their parents provided information on mental health need. Rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were high, and youth reported high satisfaction with the activities. Results suggest promise of this model for mental health promotion for urban youth.

AB Many community mental health (CMH) systems contain inefficiencies, contributing to unmet need for services among youth. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we examined the implementation of an adapted structural-strategic family intervention, Parenting with Love and Limits, in a state CMH system to increase efficiency of services to youth with co-existing internalizing and externalizing functional impairments (PLL n = 296; Treatment-As-Usual n = 296; 54% male; 81% Caucasian). Youth receiving PLL experienced shorter treatment durations and returned to CMH services at significantly lower rates than youth receiving treatment-as-usual. They also demonstrated significant decreases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms over time. Findings lay the foundation for further examination of the role of an adapted structural-strategic family treatment in increasing the efficiency of CMH systems.

AB This study examined whether physiological and behavioral indicators of emotion dysregulation assessed over the course of multisystemic therapy (MST) were related to treatment response. Participants were 180 ethnically diverse adolescents (n = 120 males), ranging in age from 12 to 17 years. Treatment response was assessed through therapist report and official arrest records. Changes in cortisol reactivity and changes in scores on a Behavioral Dysregulation subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist were used as indicators of emotion dysregulation. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses examined whether a less favorable treatment response was associated with cortisol reactivity measures collected (a) early in treatment and (b) over the course of treatment as well as with behavioral reports of emotion dysregulation reported (c) early in treatment and (d) over the course of treatment. Sex was explored as a moderator of these associations. Results indicated that both cortisol and behavioral indices of emotion dysregulation early in treatment and over the course of therapy predicted treatment responsiveness. This relationship was moderated by sex: Girls were more likely to evidence a pattern of increasing emotion regulation prior to successful therapy response. The results lend further support to the notion of incorporating emotion regulation techniques into treatment protocols for delinquent behavior.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in behavioral and emotional problems in high-functioning girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder. The results obtained by adolescents with autism spectrum disorder were compared with those of typically developing girls and boys. Correlations between parents' and adolescents' ratings were also analyzed. Participants were 35 girls and 35 boys with autism spectrum disorder, aged 11-18years, matched for chronological age and full-scale IQ. The control group consisted of 24 typically developing girls and 24 boys of the same age and IQ. The parents of adolescent participants were also included in the study. The measures used were the Child Behavior Checklist (4-18) completed by parents and Youth Self-Report (11-18) completed by adolescents. The adolescents with autism spectrum disorder presented higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems than the control group, according to both the parents' reports and the adolescents' self-reports. No sex differences were found in that respect. More differences between the assessments of adolescents and their parents occurred in the control group, and the effect size was larger.

AB Comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing problems and its risk and protective factors have not been well incorporated into developmental research, especially among racial minority youth from high-poverty neighborhoods. The present study identified a latent comorbid factor as well as specific factors underlying internalizing and externalizing problems among 592 African American adolescents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods (291 male; M age = 15.9 years, SD = 1.43 years). Stressful life events and racial discrimination were associated with higher comorbid problems, whereas stressful life events and exposure to violence were associated with higher specific externalizing problems. Collective efficacy was associated with both lower specific externalizing problems and lower comorbid problems. Moreover, high collective efficacy buffered the risk effects of stressful life events and racial discrimination on comorbid problems. Our results demonstrated the advantages of latent variable modeling to understanding comorbidity by articulating impacts of risk factors on comorbid and specific components underlying internalizing and externalizing problems. They also highlighted the protective effect of collective efficacy in mitigating risks for these problems. These findings broadly call for more studies on comorbidities in developmental psychopathology among youth from diverse sociocultural backgrounds.

AB Although experiencing child abuse (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, exposure to violence) is associated with a variety of mental health difficulties, simple exposure to abuse does not produce symptoms in every individual. The current study explored emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between a history of child abuse and symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. Adolescent females (ages 11-17 years) were asked to retrospectively report on their exposure to child abuse, current symptoms of PTSD/depression, and emotion regulation abilities. Caregiver report of adolescent emotional difficulties was also obtained. Analyses revealed that child abuse-exposed females, when compared to females without a trauma history, had worse emotion regulation abilities and increased mental health difficulties. Moreover, emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between child abuse and all assessed mental health symptoms. These findings extend previous work from adult samples, underscoring the importance of assessing emotion regulation abilities in abuse-exposed youth.

AB The ability to regulate emotion plays a key role in the development of prosocial behavior. This study uses the self-determination theory conceptualization of emotion regulation to explore whether children's emotion regulation styles differentially predict their prosocial behavior in class. For the study, 240 sixth and seventh grade Israeli students and their teachers responded to self-report measures. The results of structural equation modeling showed integrative emotion regulation predicts student prosocial behavior, both directly and through the mediation of empathy towards classmates. These findings suggest integrative emotion regulation can play an important role in promoting children's psychosocial adjustment in class. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Serum inflammatory markers have been studied in adults with anxiety and depression, but little is known about cytokine levels in young adolescents with emotional disorders. The objective of this study is to compare serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) between adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents from the same community without internalizing disorders. A total of 134 non-medicated subjects (n = 76 with internalizing disorders) were recruited from a larger sample of 2457 individuals. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were quantified and psychiatric diagnosis was evaluated using structured clinical interviews. Adolescents with internalizing disorders presented significantly higher levels of IL-6 as compared to youngsters without internalizing disorders. Differences between groups in IL-10 levels were not statistically significant. This study points out that IL-6 levels may be associated with internalizing disorders in youths and suggests that inflammation might be an early biomarker of emotional distress. High levels of cytokines may adversely affect general health in the long-term, which raise broader issues in terms of public health if results are replicated.

AB The cognitive regulation of emotion is impaired in major depressive disorder and has been linked to an imbalance of pre-frontal-subcortical brain activity. Despite suggestions that this relationship represents a neurodevelopmental marker of depression, few studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation in depressed youth. We combined a 'cognitive reappraisal' paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the neural correlates of emotional regulation in a large sample of non-medicated depressed adolescents and young adults (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 64). As compared with healthy controls, young people with depression were less able to reduce negative affect during reappraisal, which corresponded to blunted modulation of amygdala activity. While in healthy individuals amygdala activation was modulated by age, no such relationship was observed in depressed individuals. Heightened activation of the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) and reduced activation of the dorsal midline cortex was also found for the depressed group. Overall, these findings suggest that brain systems that support cognitive reappraisal are functionally altered in youth depression. We argue that excessive engagement of the vmPFC in particular, may be central to understanding how the process of putting a 'positive spin' on negative emotional material may be altered in depressed youth.

AB Research on cumulative risk is growing, however, little work has occurred in low- or middle-income countries, and few studies have focused on processes linking risk to outcomes. This study explored relations between components of cumulative risk and adjustment in a sample of 324 South African youth (M age = 13.11 years; SD = 1.54 years; 65% female; 56% Black/African; 14% Colored; 23% Indian; 7% White), and tested competing models of emotion dysregulation as a mediator or moderator of risk-adjustment links. Data was collected from youth and their female caregivers during home interviews. Structural equation models and regression analyses accounting for age and sex contributions revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated associations between sociodemographic risk and internalizing symptoms, externalizing problem behavior, and drug use severity, and moderated links between psychosocial risk and internalizing symptoms and externalizing problem behavior. For the mediator models, sociodemographic risk was associated with impaired emotion regulation, which in turn was linked with heightened adjustment difficulties. For the moderator models, psychosocial risk was linked with adjustment problems only when emotion dysregulation was high. These data indicate the importance of disentangling components of cumulative risk. Future research within the South African cultural context might build on these findings by adapting and testing school- or family-based prevention or intervention programs that include modules on emotion regulation.

AB Childhood neglect is associated with risk behaviors in adolescence, including substance use. There is evidence that internalizing behaviors may serve as a mechanism linking childhood neglect and substance use; however, further research is needed to examine this developmental pathway. According to developmental and ecological approaches, the neighborhood context and the developmental timing of maltreatment should both be considered when examining the sequelae of childhood neglect. Hence, the present study uses a longitudinal sample of youth (N = 965, 49.1% female, 59.2% African-American) to examine the influence of timing in the relationship between childhood neglect and adolescent psychopathology, and to examine the indirect effects of child neglect on substance use via internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Furthermore, the role of neighborhood disorder in this indirect effect was tested. Five data collection time points were used: Time 1(M (age) = 4.557, SD (age) = .701), Time 2 (M (age) = 6.422, SD (age) = .518), Time 3 (M (age) = 12.370, SD (age) = .443), Time 4 (M (age) = 14.359, SD (age) = .452), and Time 5 (M (age) = 16.316, SD (age) = .615). The findings showed that internalizing problems mediated the link between the severity of neglect in early childhood and adolescent substance use, and this pathway was moderated by neighborhood disorder. These results have implications for preventative interventions aimed toward reducing substance use for at-risk adolescents.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems commonly co-occur with adolescent post-traumatic stress and grief reactions. However, little is known about whether these co-occurring symptoms moderate adolescents' response to sequenced components of trauma- and grief-focused interventions. Forty-four middle school students (aged 12-14) rated their self-identified Top Problem during a 17-week flexibly tailored course of Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCTA), a group-based treatment for traumatized and bereaved youth. Baseline internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined as potential moderators of adolescents' response to skills-building (Module I), narrative-sharing (Modules II and III), and developmental progression (Module IV) phases of intervention. Piecewise analyses of change during the three treatment phases indicated that adolescents with more internalizing symptoms showed significantly less improvement during the skills-building phase and significantly more improvement during the narrative construction phase. Findings provide preliminary evidence that: (a) traumatized and bereaved adolescents show different trajectories of response to different TGCTA components as a function of internalizing versus externalizing baseline symptoms and (b) assessing self-nominated problems and broad-spectrum internalizing and externalizing symptoms can guide trauma- and bereavement-informed treatment planning and monitoring.

AB This study investigated the relationship between self-reported time in bed and sleep quality in association with self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a sample of 285 elementary school students (52 % female) recruited from a rural Midwestern elementary school. Path models were used to estimate proposed associations, controlling for grade level and gender. Curvilinear associations were found between time in bed and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and irritability. Marginal curvilinear trends were found between time in bed and emotion dysregulation, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression. Sleep quality was negatively associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, irritability, reactive aggression, and delinquency engagement. Gender and grade differences were found across models. Findings suggest that examining self-reported time in bed (both linear and quadratic) and sleep quality is important for understanding internalizing and externalizing symptoms associated with sleep in school-age youth. Incorporating self-reported sleep assessments into clinical practice and school-based evaluations may have implications for a child's adjustment.

DE eating pathology; emotion regulation; attachment; adolescence
AB The aim of the present work is to explore associations between eating pathology (EP), emotion regulation (ER) and attachment in a non-clinical adolescent sample; and whether insecure attachment and difficulties in emotion regulation explain EP. A sample of 485 adolescents (240 females) aged 12-18, completed the EDI-2, DERS and EPERIC questionnaires. Sex differences were analyzed. Sex differences in EP level occur since the age of 14-15. Associations with high effect sizes between these three constructs were found. It is possible to predict EP from difficulties in emotion regulation and insecure attachment features (R-2 Nagelkerke=.305 in females, and .236 in males). EP shows strong association with fear of rejection or abandonment in females and with preference for independence in males. Conclusions. There are sex differences on the associations between these three constructs considered in the present study and in EP explanation too. This has implications in prevention.

AB Self-esteem, generally regarded as an important indicator of adolescents' mental health, was assessed by a self-report questionnaire in a school sample of 593 subjects who had been assessed at 3 time points over 7 years between 11 and 25 years of age within the Zurich Psychology and Psychopathology Study (ZAPPS). Cross-lagged panel analyses of the longitudinal data from ZAPPS indicated that self-esteem was predictive of internalizing problems and had an impact on internalizing symptoms when the analyses were adjusted for coping behavior, efficiency of social networks, and impact of stressful life events. Self-esteem was also stable (r = .37-.60) within the observed age range, after controlling for prior levels of the predicted variables. The findings support the impact of self-esteem on mental health and indicate the importance of addressing self-esteem in prevention and intervention programs.

AB Intervention in psychological flexibility as emotional competence in adolescents: a case series. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological flexibility program in adolescents. An A-B-A-type within-subject replication design was used. Twenty-five students (53.8% was women) from a compulsory secondary education centre were enrolled from 129 adolescents aged 13-15 years old (M = 13; SD =.76). The primary dependent variables analysed in the study are emotional intelligence, measured with Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion, evaluated with Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y); and acceptance levels, evaluated with Willingness & Action Measure for Children and Adolescents (WAM-C/A). Impulsivity, measured with Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11-A). Treatment consisted of 9 weekly one-hour sessions for an intervention program based on three protocols in Contextual Therapies (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy more specifically). At the beginning, 50% of the participants showed experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion patterns. Results showed significant decrease in attention, perceived emotional intelligence, and experiential avoidance Therefore, this intervention program has improved cognitive defusion and experiential avoidance.

AB Little is known about adolescent exposure to and factors associated with violence in Malawi. The aim of this research was to describe the prevalence of exposure to violence among adolescents in Malawi, and test the hypotheses that such exposures are associated with gender-based violent attitudes, and with internalizing and externalizing problems. In 2014, 561 primary school pupils were interviewed (50% girls), and logistic regression analysis was performed on gender-stratified data, adjusting for sociodemographic differences. Both girls and boys had witnessed domestic violence (28.5% & 29.6%), experienced emotional abuse at home (23.1% & 22.9%), physical abuse at home (28.1% & 30.4%), physical abuse at school (42.4% & 36.4%), and been bullied (33.8% & 39.6%). Among girls, internalized violent attitudes towards women were associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 2.1) and physical abuse at school (OR 1.7). Condoning rape was associated with physical abuse at school (OR 1.9). Bullying perpetration was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 4.5). Depression was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 3.8) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.4). Among boys, violent attitudes towards women and condoning rape were not associated with violence exposure. Bullying perpetration was associated with having been a victim of bullying (OR 2.9) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.7). Depression was associated with emotional abuse at home (OR 2.9), domestic violence (OR 2.4) and physical abuse at school (OR 2.5). These findings can inform programs designed to reduce violence victimization among Malawian girls, both in homes and schools. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although child maltreatment exposure is a recognized risk factor for self-harm, mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. Self-harm may function as a compensatory strategy to regulate distressing emotions. This cross-sectional study examines if emotion dysregulation mediates between the severity of maltreatment exposure and self-harm, adjusting for demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Participants were 108 adolescent patients recruited from a psychiatric hospital in Singapore (mean age 17.0 years, SD= 1.65; 59.3% female). Study measures included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF), Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (FASM), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of maltreatment exposure on self harm via emotion dysregulation, controlling for demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Indirect effects were tested using bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI). Results showed that self-harm was highly prevalent in our sample (75.9%). Emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms were found to be associated with higher self-harm frequency. In addition, results from path analysis showed that the association between the severity of maltreatment exposure and self-harm frequency was significantly mediated by emotion dysregulation B= 0.07, p <0.05, 95% CI [0.02, 0.16]. Thus, emotion dysregulation may be a proximal mechanism linking maltreatment exposure and adolescent self-harm. Notably, self-harm may represent maladaptive attempts to manage emotion dysregulation that may have resulted from maltreatment. Findings from the study have implications for the prevention and treatment of self-harm in maltreated youth. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective To examine maternal and child internalizing symptoms as predictors of early adolescent emotional eating in a longitudinal framework spanning three critical developmental periods (preschool, elementary school, and early adolescence). Methods Participants were 170 children recruited at preschool age for a longitudinal study. When children were 5.25 years, their mothers completed ratings of their own internalizing symptoms. During the spring of 4th grade, children completed measures of internalizing symptoms. In early adolescence, youth completed a measure of emotional eating. Results Maternal and child internalizing symptoms predicted adolescent emotional eating. The results indicated that child psychopathology moderated the association between maternal psychopathology (except for maternal anxiety) and early adolescent emotional eating. There was no evidence of mediation. Conclusions Pediatric psychologists are encouraged to provide early screening of, and interventions for, maternal and child internalizing symptoms to prevent children's emotional eating.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Anxiety disorders are the leading cause of mental illness in adolescence. While anxious adolescents show impairments in emotion processing and deficits in emotion regulation, few studies have attempted to improve emotion regulation within these populations.
   Method: This study used a multi-method design to test a newly developed emotion regulation training aimed at improving insight into emotions and instructing cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of cognitive reappraisal was investigated in 27 clinically anxious youth (Age: M=12.36, SD=2.59) and 43 healthy controls (Age: M=13.07, SD=2.19) using psychophysiological measures. Specifically, heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and visual fixations were recorded while youth had to up-or downregulate their emotions in response to affective pictures in the Psychophysiological Indicators of Emotion Regulation (PIER) task.
   Results: The novel training effectively improved self-reported emotion regulation and momentary anxiety in both groups. Moreover, initial group differences in emotional reactivity mostly disappeared when participants were instructed to apply emotion regulation in the task. However, pupil dilation data suggested that participants with anxiety disorders required more cognitive resources for the upregulation of negative affect to counteract this effect.
   Limitations: The relatively small sample size and large age range could hamper detection of additional group differences that may exist.
   Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that anxious youth can apply cognitive reappraisal to a similar extent as healthy adolescents after emotion regulation training but may need to exert more effort to do so. This training could be a valuable addition to current treatment programs.

AB BackgroundAlthough music therapy (MT) is considered an effective intervention for young people with mental health needs, its efficacy in clinical settings is unclear. We therefore examined the efficacy of MT in clinical practice.
   MethodsTwo hundred and fifty-one child (8-16years, with social, emotional, behavioural and developmental difficulties) and parent dyads from six Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service community care facilities in Northern Ireland were randomised to 12 weekly sessions of MT plus usual care [n=123; 76 in final analyses] or usual care alone [n=128; 105 in final analyses]. Follow-up occurred at 13weeks and 26weeks postrandomisation. Primary outcome was improvement in communication (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) (SSIS) at 13weeks. Secondary outcomes included social functioning, self-esteem, depression and family functioning.
   ResultsThere was no significant difference for the child SSIS at week 13 (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95% CI -1.2 to 6.1; p=.19) or for the guardian SSIS (0.5; 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8; p=.78). However, for participants aged 13 and over in the intervention group, the child SSIS communication was significantly improved (6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.5; p=.007) but not the guardian SSIS (1.1; 95% CI -2.9 to 5.2; p=.59). Overall, self-esteem was significantly improved and depression scores were significantly lower at week 13. There was no significant difference in family or social functioning at week 13.
   ConclusionsWhile the findings provide some evidence for the integration of music therapy into clinical practice, differences relating to subgroups and secondary outcomes indicate the need for further study. ISRCTN Register; ISRCTN96352204.

AB Compared with full-terms, preterm individuals are more at risk from infancy to adulthood for developing internalizing symptoms. Early maternal interactive behavior, especially maternal sensitivity, has been found to be a resilience factor in the developmental outcome of preterm children. The present longitudinal study aimed at examining whether early interactive parenting behaviors have a long term impact on the internalizing symptoms of preterm-born young adolescents. A total sample of 36 very preterm and 22 full-term children participated in an 11-year follow-up study. Maternal interactive behavior was assessed during a mother-infant interaction when the infant was 18 months old. At 11 years, internalizing symptoms were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction between groups (preterm/full-term) and maternal sensitivity at 18 months significantly explained CBCL internalizing symptoms at 11 years (beta = -0.526; p < 0.05). Specifically, although prematurity was related to internalizing problems, preterm children with higher maternal sensitivity did not differ from their full-term-born peers on the CBCL internalizing problems domain. These results suggest that maternal sensitivity is a long-term resilience factor preventing the development of internalizing problems at early adolescence in very preterm individuals.

AB Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate atypical processing of, and memory for, self-referenced information, which may contribute to the heightened rates of co-occurring internalizing problems. We assessed affective and cognitive aspects of self-referential processing in verbally-fluent children with ASD (N=79), and an age-matched comparison sample (COM, N=73) of children without an autism diagnosis. We examined group differences in these two aspects of the self-system, and their joint contributions to individual differnces in internalizing problems. Using a self-referenced memory (SRM) task, participants indicated whether a series of positive and negative trait adjectives described themselves and a well-known fictional character. Participants were then surprised with a recognition memory test on the same adjectives. Overall, individuals with ASD showed a reduction in the extent to which they preferentially endorsed positive over negative trait adjectives about themselves, and a reduction in their preferential memory for self-over other-referenced information. Across the full sample, these two aspects of self-referential processing jointly predicted self-reported internalizing problems. Specifically, self-evaluations were strongly and inversely associated with internalizing problems but only for children with relatively high SRM. These findings suggest that the salience of the self influences the extent to which affective self-evaluations impact emotional functioning for youth both with and without ASD. Implications for basic (e.g., developmental) and translational (e.g., intervention) research are discussed. (C) 2016 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examined the secondary effects of Behavioral Couples Treatment (BCT) for parents with substance use disorder on youth reports of internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms). Participants were 59 triads (father, mothers, and youth; 32 girls, 27 boys) in which one or both parents met criteria for drug or alcohol use disorder (or both). Mothers, fathers, and youth completed pretreatment, post-intervention, and 6-month post-intervention follow-up assessments. Two piecewise latent growth models examined whether number of sessions attended was associated with parents' relationship satisfaction or its growth over time, and in turn if parents' relationship satisfaction was uniquely associated with youth depressive/anxiety symptoms or their growth over time. A significant indirect effect at post-intervention revealed the number of sessions attended contributed to decreases in youth depressive symptoms via increases in mothers' and fathers' relationship satisfaction. Mothers' relationship satisfaction uniquely mediated the relationship between number of sessions attended and youth depressive symptoms at post-intervention. With regards to fathers, there was a non-significant trend such that increases in sessions attended was associated with decreases in youth depressive symptoms post- intervention via increasing relationship satisfaction among fathers. Findings suggest that BCT may have protective secondary effects in reducing youth reports of depressive symptoms among couples in which one or both parents have substance use disorder.

AB Dating aggression occurs frequently in early to mid-adolescence and has negative repercussions for psychosocial adjustment and physical health. The patterns of behavior learned during this developmental timeframe may persist in future dating relationships, underscoring the need to identify risk factors for this outcome. The current study examined longitudinal relations between beliefs supporting aggression, anger regulation, and dating aggression. Participants were 176 middle school students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade (50 % female; 82 % African American). No direct effects were found between beliefs supporting reactive or proactive aggression and dating aggression. Beliefs supporting reactive aggression predicted increased rates of anger dysregulation, and beliefs supporting proactive aggression led to subsequent increases in anger inhibition. Anger dysregulation and inhibition were associated with higher frequencies of dating aggression. An indirect effect was found for the relation between beliefs supporting reactive aggression and dating aggression via anger dysregulation. Another indirect effect emerged for the relation between beliefs supporting proactive aggression and dating aggression through anger inhibition. The study's findings suggested that beliefs supporting proactive and reactive aggression were differentially related to emotion regulation processes, and identified anger dysregulation and inhibition as risk factors for dating aggression among adolescents.

AB In the educational psychology field, responding to the social and emotional needs unmet by traditional academic education, through emotional education, is currently sought. This is considered necessary for an emotionally healthy development, with healthy emotional relationships and mental states. Hence the importance to develop emotional skills, both in the classroom and in the family, to provide children with more tools, that help them to face multiple situations throughout their lives. In this sense, the end of childhood constitutes a real opportunity to assimilating emotional competencies, making responsible decisions, solving problems and dealing with risk situations. Therefore, the interest in this work is to reflect, from a theoretical perspective, on the development of emotional competencies and responsible decision making in pre-adolescents, examining the involvement of teachers and parents in this process.

AB A large body of research has linked relational aggression (RA) to indices of psychosocial and academic maladjustment. Recent work suggests that urban, minority adolescent girls who experience peer aggression are at particularly high risk for negative outcomes, including internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and yet this population has been underrepresented in the literature. Despite the high prevalence of RA, only a small portion of adolescents experience chronic victimization and/or develop serious, lasting effects. Identifying factors which confer vulnerability in the context of RA may have important implications for intervention and prevention. The present study theorized that heavy reliance on experiential avoidance (EA) would be associated with history of RA victimization, and would predict internalizing problems. We also hypothesized that self-reported EA would be positively related to sadness in adolescents who experienced negative mood following an in vivo laboratory-based social exclusion experience. Participants included 58 female adolescents (aged 11-14 years) recruited from urban schools and community centers. Results supported our hypotheses. EA was associated with history of RA victimization, and predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms, even when accounting for history of RA victimization. EA was also a significant predictor of more negative mood following a social exclusion experience, even when accounting for baseline mood. Implications and recommendations for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB In the present study, we examined how unstructured (e.g., spending time with friends or co-workers) and structured (e.g., attending social events at a place of workshop, sports teams) social participation changed from before to after high school for youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as the longitudinal and concurrent relations between social participation and internalizing symptoms. Participants included 36 families of youth with ASD who were all in their last year of high school at the first time point of data collection, and who were out of high school for an average of 9 months at the second time point. Social participation and internalizing symptoms were determined using parental report. There was no average change in the amount of unstructured social participation after high school exit, although substantial individual variability was observed. Participation in structured social activities significantly declined after high school exit. Youth who had more structured social participation while in high school were significantly more likely to have gains in their unstructured social participation after high school exit. Turning to relationships between internalizing and social activities, more internalizing symptoms while youth with ASD were in high school significantly predicted increasing social isolation after high school exit (both in terms of structured and unstructured activities). Results point to the likely need for additional supports during the transition to adulthood for youth with ASD who have internalizing problems. Autism Res2016.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are among the most debilitating psychiatric conditions. Behaviors and traits associated with these disorders can have profound influences on those surrounding the affected individual. Accordingly, researchers have begun to examine effects of these symptoms on parent-child relationships. Theoretical and empirical work suggests that one mechanism linking maternal psychopathology to child symptoms is familial transmission of emotion dysregulation. The authors examined children's emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child behavior problems 1 year later. Analyses revealed that a composite of maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms had a direct effect on child internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms. Associations between maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and youth problems were partially mediated by child emotion regulation difficulties, even with maternal depression and other relevant covariates included in the models. Thus, maternal BPD/ASPD symptoms and child emotion regulation difficulties represent potential targets for prevention of psychopathology among youth.

AB Maternal depression is a well-documented risk factor for youth depression, and taking into account its severity and chronicity may provide important insight into the degree of risk conferred. This study explored the degree to which the severity/chronicity of maternal depression history explained variance in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms above and beyond current maternal depressive symptoms among 171 youth (58 % male) ages 8 to 12 over a span of 3 years. Severity and chronicity of past maternal depression and current maternal depressive symptoms were examined as predictors of parent-reported youth internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, as well as youth self-reported depressive symptoms. Severity and chronicity of past maternal depression did not account for additional variance in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms at Time 1 beyond what was accounted for by maternal depressive symptoms at Time 1. Longitudinal growth curve modeling indicated that prior severity/chronicity of maternal depression predicted levels of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms at each time point when controlling for current maternal depressive symptoms at each time point. Chronicity of maternal depression, apart from severity, also predicted rate of change in youth externalizing symptoms over time. These findings highlight the importance of screening and assessing for current maternal depressive symptoms, as well as the nature of past depressive episodes. Possible mechanisms underlying the association between severity/chronicity of maternal depression and youth outcomes, such as residual effects from depressive history on mother-child interactions, are discussed.

AB Background: Psychopathy research has thus far focused mostly on child, male, and delinquent samples, but the results are most likely non-generalizable to adolescent girls with mental health disorders.Aim: The present study aimed to compare self-rated psychopathic traits between female psychiatric outpatients and girls in the community, and to investigate how psychopathic traits relate to psychiatric disorders.Method: The outpatient sample comprised 163 girls aged 15-17-years recruited from municipal mental health services. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed based on the ICD-10 classification. The community sample comprised 355 girls from secondary, vocational, and high schools. The Youth Psychopathic trait Inventory (YPI) served as a self-assessment tool.Results: Treatment-seeking girls exhibit a more impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle than do girls in the community. Girls with externalizing psychopathology, unlike those with an internalizing disorder, exhibit more deficient affective experience than do girls in the community. Psychopathic traits associate with having a psychiatric disorder, a depressive disorder, ADHD, and a conduct disorder.Conclusions: The psychiatric examination of treatment-seeking adolescent girls would likely benefit from screening for psychopathy and its underlying components.

AB Objective: Individuals' lay beliefs about mental health problems and attitudes toward mental health care are thought to be influenced by the cultural background of these individuals. In the current study, we investigated differences between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents and adolescents in lay beliefs about emotional problems and attitudes toward mental health care. Additionally, among immigrant Dutch parents, we examined the associations between acculturation orientations and lay beliefs about emotional problems as well as attitudes toward mental health care. Method: In total, 349 pairs of parents and their adolescent children participated in our study (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese-Dutch, 87 Turkish-Dutch, 82 Moroccan-Dutch). A vignette was used to examine participants' lay beliefs. Results: Immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents differed in their lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care, whereas hardly any differences were revealed among their children. Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch parents showed more passive and fewer active solutions to emotional problems compared to native Dutch parents. Additionally, Moroccan-Dutch and Surinamese-Dutch parents reported greater fear of mental health care compared to native Dutch parents. Furthermore, the results showed that immigrant Dutch parents who were more strongly oriented toward the Dutch culture reported less fear of mental health care. Conclusion: Our results showed clear differences in lay beliefs and attitudes toward mental health care between immigrant Dutch and native Dutch parents but not between their children. Substantial differences were also found between parents from different immigrant Dutch populations as well as within the population of immigrant Dutch parents.

AB Social anxiety and depression are common mental health problems among adolescents and are frequently comorbid. Primary aims of this study were to (1) elucidate the nature of individual differences in specific emotion regulation deficits among adolescents with symptoms of social anxiety and depression, and (2) determine whether repetitive negative thinking (RNT) functions as a transdiagnostic factor. A diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065) completed measures assessing emotion regulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression. Results indicated that adolescents with high levels of social anxiety and depression symptoms reported decreased emotional awareness, dysregulated emotion expression, and reduced use of emotion management strategies. The hypothesized structural model in which RNT functions as a transdiagnostic factor exhibited a better fit than an alternative model in which worry and rumination function as separate predictors of symptomatology. Findings implicate emotion regulation deficits and RNT in the developmental psychopathology of youth anxiety and mood disorders.

AB Gendered interpersonal processes may explain the elevated rates of internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls relative to boys. Two such processes are peer social rejection and social support. The current study assessed for gender differences in the effect of 7th grade peer social rejection on 10th grade internalizing symptoms, as well as the moderating effects of social support from family and from friends in a sample of 749 (49 % female) Mexican American adolescents, an understudied population with a unique social culture. Peer social rejection significantly predicted increased internalizing symptoms for girls. Although buffering effects of social support were not found, there were significant moderating effects of both sources of support for boys, such that at low levels of social support, peer social rejection was associated with decreased internalizing symptoms, and at high levels of social support, peer social rejection was associated with increased internalizing symptoms. The results help unpack the nuances of the interpersonal processes that lead to differential adjustment for adolescent boys and girls at this critical developmental stage.

AB This study investigated the associations between stressful family life events and adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and the interactive effects of family life events and cortisol reactivity on problem behaviors. In a sample of 100 mothers and their adolescents (M age = 15.09; SD age = .98; 68 % girls), adolescent cortisol reactivity was measured in response to a mother-adolescent conflict interaction task designed to elicit a stress response. Mothers reported on measures of family life events and adolescent problem behaviors. Results indicated that a heightened adolescent cortisol response moderated the relations between stressful family life events and both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results support context-dependent theoretical models, suggesting that for adolescents with higher cortisol reactivity (compared to those with lower cortisol reactivity), higher levels of stressful family life events were associated with greater problem behaviors, whereas lower levels of stressful family life events were related to fewer problem behaviors.

AB Self-control may act as a protective factor against the development of internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents. However, little research has examined how self-control functions within and across different types of communities. Using two cohorts from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (N = 1,072; 51.40% female), we examined how self-control and neighborhood characteristics were independently and jointly associated with these behaviors. Using latent profile analysis, we categorized neighborhoods based on several characteristics known to be associated with youth outcomes, including violence, concentrated disadvantage, and collective efficacy. Then we examined how self-control was associated with youth internalizing and externalizing problems within and across neighborhoods. Results suggest that self-control was a protective feature in only some types of disadvantaged and dangerous neighborhoods. We discuss findings in terms of implications for programs and policies to support youth mental health.

AB Objective: Irritable mood is common in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Research to date has primarily comprised cross-sectional studies; thus, little is known about the antecedents of irritability. Furthermore, existing cross-sectional studies generally focus on the association between irritability and comorbidities and do not examine broader aspects of functioning. Finally, previous research has neglected to include child-report of irritability. This study aimed to address these gaps using data from a longitudinal study of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   Method: Children aged 5-13 years (mean = 10.2; standard deviation =1.9) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were recruited from pediatric practices across Victoria, Australia. This study reports on those who had reached adolescence (1 2 years or older, mean= 13.8; standard deviation= 1.2) at the 3-year follow-up (n= 140). Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. At follow-up, parent-reported and adolescent self reported irritability was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index. Parent and adolescent outcomes measured at follow-up included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity, sleep, behavior and parent mental health.
   Results: Children with externalizing problems at age 10 had higher parent-reported irritability (beta=0.31, 95% confidence interval = [0.17,-0.45], p= 0.001) in adolescence. Cross-sectional analyses found that irritability was associated with increased attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity and sleep problems; poorer emotional, behavioral and social functioning; and poorer parent mental health.
   Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of assessing for and managing early conduct problems in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as these predict ongoing irritability which, in turn, is associated with poorer functioning across a number of domains.

AB Are internalizing and externalizing behavior problems interrelated via mutually reinforcing relationships (with each behavior leading to increases over time in levels of the other behavior) or mutually suppressing relationships (with each behavior leading to decreases over time in levels of the other behavior)? Past research on the directionality of these relationships has led to ambiguous results, particularly in adolescence. Furthermore, the extent to which prior results will generalize to adolescents with low levels of cognitive abilities remains unknown. This second limit is particularly important, given that these adolescents are known to present higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors than their peers with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities, and that the mechanisms involved in the reciprocal relationships between these two types of behaviors may differ across both populations. This study examines the directionality of the longitudinal relationships between externalizing and internalizing behavior problems as rated by teachers across three measurement waves (corresponding to Grades 8-10) in matched samples of 138 adolescents (34.78 % girls) with low levels of cognitive abilities and 556 adolescents (44.88 % girls) with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities. The results showed that the measurement structure was fully equivalent across time periods and groups of adolescents, revealing high levels of developmental stability in both types of problems, and moderately high levels of cross-sectional associations. Levels of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors were higher among adolescents with low levels of cognitive abilities relative to those with average-to-high levels of cognitive abilities. Finally, the predictive analyses revealed negative reciprocal longitudinal relationships (i.e., mutually suppressing relationships) between externalizing and internalizing problems, a result that was replicated within samples of adolescents with low, and average-to-high levels of cognitive ability.

AB There is growing interest in understanding how beliefs about emotion regulation are related to individual emotional experiences. Extant studies have mainly focused on explicit beliefs about emotion regulation among individuals in Western societies. The current study examined implicit emotion regulation and explored their contributions to emotional outcomes in 147 Chinese adolescents. Participants were tested on their implicit beliefs about emotion regulation and their negative emotion experiences. Results showed that the down-regulation was implicitly evaluated as more positive than up-regulation. Moreover, positive implicit beliefs about down-regulation increased with age. Among younger adolescents, those who evaluated down-regulation more positively had less negative emotional experiences. These results suggest that down-regulation may have important implications in Chinese culture.

AB Positive psychology is the scientific study of positive emotions, positive thoughts and positive behaviors that serve as protective factors to help people bounce back and recover from stress. Fredrickson's broaden and build model postulates that positive emotions catalyze upward spirals toward future well-being by broadening people's positive thoughts and behaviors. This study investigated direct and interactional effects of emotional competence and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms among a sample of secondary school students in Hong Kong, China. A cross sectional survey design was adopted, and data was collected from 513 adolescents (197 males, 316 females, mean age=13.80) from four secondary schools. Results showed that dispositional optimism and emotional competence were significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms. In addition, emotional competence enhanced the protective effects of dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms. Therefore, despite their culture-specific meanings in the Chinese context, dispositional optimism and emotional competence were found to independently and jointly protect Chinese adolescents to offset depression, which lends empirical support to the cross-cultural validity of the two positive psychological constructs and the Broaden and Build model of positive emotions. This study sheds light on promoting a positive psychology model that includes both cognitive and emotional positive psychological factors for depression prevention or early intervention.

AB Attachment-based theories and related research illustrate that emotion regulation develops in the context of a secure relationship between a child and caregiver. When a secure bond is broken, such as in the context of betrayal trauma, children fail to develop necessary emotion regulation skills which can lead to an array of relational problems. The current study examined the relations between betrayal trauma history, type of communication during a stressful interpersonal laboratory task, and emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of trauma-exposed adolescents. Results showed that adolescents with a betrayal trauma history reported more emotion regulation difficulties and exhibited more aggressive and fewer positive communication behaviors when engaged in a stressful interpersonal task with their mothers than did adolescents exposed only to nonbetrayal trauma. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relation between betrayal trauma history and negative communication. The clinical and developmental implications from these findings are discussed.

AB Previous research indicates that students who drop out of high school are at risk for a number of negative outcomes. Both ecological and individual risk factors contribute to students' propensity for dropout. This study examined the effectiveness of a targeted dropout prevention program at improving academic achievement and investigated whether improved social support and emotional competencies partially mediated the association between intervention participation and student outcomes. A sample of 110 middle and high school students (55 intervention participants and 55 students in a matched control group) completed surveys investigating their social-emotional assets and schools provided academic data for participants. Structural equation modeling revealed that students who participated in the program had higher academic achievement compared to the control group. Prior levels of academic achievement moderated the effectiveness of the program with students with low initial levels of academic achievement benefiting more. Emotional competencies and social support did not mediate the relation between participation and achievement. The intervention was related to improved academic achievement among participants; however, the means by which it was effective was unclear. Given the evidence that the program was more effective for some students than others, targeting interventions to meet specific needs of students may be advantageous. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Posttraumatic distress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) may coexist in trauma survivors, but there are mixed relationships between PTSD and PTG. To elucidate their relationship and constructs, it is necessary to examine simultaneously predictive factors, and to compare their determining factors. The aim of this study was to increasing our understanding the relationship between PTSD and PTG by examining simultaneously the role of social support and emotion regulation in PTSD and PTG among adolescents after the earthquake. Methods: Six months after the Ya'an earthquake, 315 middle school students in Lushan county were assessed using measures of trauma exposure, social support, and emotion regulation, as well as Child PTSD Symptom Scale and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Results: Social support had significant direct association with PTG but not with PTSD, but social support had a negative indirect prediction on PTSD and a positive indirect prediction on PTG through cognitive reappraisal. Social support, through expressive suppression, had a significant and indirect prediction on PTSD, but a nonsignificant indirect prediction on PTG. Conclusions: This study indicate that the predictive mechanism of PTSD and PTG were different and further suggest that PTSD and PTG are separate, independent dimensions of psychological experiences following adversity.

AB Mothers' and fathers' emotion socialization (ES) practices have been widely associated with child socioemotional outcomes. To extend this research, we examined the bidirectional relationship between parent ES practices (supportive and non-supportive parenting) and internalizing behavior problems in children of Anglo and Latino parents. Participants were 182 mothers and 162 fathers and their children with or without intellectual disability (ID). We compared the stability of mother and father ES practices across child ages 4-8. We utilized cross-lagged panel modeling to examine the bidirectional relationship between parents' ES and child internalizing behavior problems. Emotion socialization practices differed across time by parent gender, with mothers displaying higher levels of supportive parenting and lower levels of non-supportive parenting than fathers. Cross-lagged panel models revealed differential relationships between child internalizing behaviors and emotion socialization practices by parent gender and by ethnicity. Implications for intervening with culturally diverse families of children with ID are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the role of certain personality traits, such as callous-unemotional traits, behavioral activation system (BAS), and emotion regulation in the associations between proactive and reactive relational aggression (RA) and Cyberbullying (CB). Participants were 347 Greek adolescents who completed a self-report questionnaire. Based on prior evidence the present study examined personality characteristics both as predictors of relational and cyber aggression, as well as moderators in bidirectional models between these aggressive forms. Results showed that high callous and uncaring traits as well as low BAS moderated the pathway from CB to proactive and reactive RA. Further, proactive and reactive RA were positively associated with CB at high levels of callous and uncaring traits and low levels of BAS. Low cognitive reappraisal moderated the links between both RA functions (i.e. proactive and reactive) to CB. Finally, adolescents who engage in proactive and reactive RA and use high cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions are more likely to use CB. Overall, these results indicate that relational and cyber aggression share some common ground and aggressors do not significantly differ in terms of their personality traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current study examined longitudinal relations between overt and relational victimization, sadness and anger dysregulation, and depressive and anxiety symptoms across 6 months among an ethnically diverse sample of sixth graders (N = 485; 48% male; 65% African American). No direct longitudinal relations were found between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms or between internalizing symptoms and peer victimization, and these findings were consistent across gender and disability status. The relation between overt victimization and subsequent increases in relational victimization was stronger for youth with versus without high incidence disabilities. Significant indirect effects were found for overt victimization on both depressive and anxiety symptoms via sadness dysregulation. The strength of the indirect effects did not differ by gender. Findings highlight the merits of school-based violence prevention programs that address emotional management and are embedded within multi-tiered school environment interventions.

AB In order to assess the relationships among borderline personality disorder features, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and emotion dysregulation, 122 community-dwelling Italian adolescents were administered by the Italian translations of the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children-11, the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Regression models showed that both Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI) and DERS scores significantly predicted Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children-11 total score; moreover, the DSHI total score significantly predicted the DERS total score. Our findings suggest that borderline personality features in adolescence are moderately, albeit significantly related to NSSI, and that emotion dysregulation does not completely account for the association between borderline personality features and NSSI, although it seems to explain a non-trivial proportion of this relationship.

AB Despite major advances in the development of interventions for youth anxiety and depression, approximately 30% of youths with anxiety do not respond to cognitive behavioral treatment, and youth depression treatments yield modest symptom decreases overall. Identifying networks of modifiable risk and maintenance factors that contribute to both youth anxiety and depression (i.e., internalizing problems) may enhance and broaden treatment benefits by informing the development of mechanism-targeted interventions. A particularly powerful network is the rich array of family processes linked to internalizing problems (e.g., parenting styles, parental mental health problems, and sibling relationships). Here, we propose a new theoretical model, the triadic model of family process, to organize theory and evidence around modifiable, transdiagnostic family factors that may contribute to youth internalizing problems. We describe the model's implications for intervention, and we propose strategies for testing the model in future research. The model provides a framework for studying associations among family processes, their relation to youth internalizing problems, and family-based strategies for strengthening prevention and treatment.

AB The purposes of the present study were to: (1) describe rates of peer victimization in young adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, (2) evaluate the association between types of peer victimization (i.e., physical, relational, and reputational) and internalizing problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and self-esteem), and (3) examine whether associations between victimization and internalizing problems differ for males or females. Participants were 131 middle-school students (ages 11-15 years, 73 % male, 76 % White) diagnosed with ADHD who completed ratings of victimization, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Over half of the participants (57 %) reported experiencing at least one victimization behavior at a rate of once per week or more, with higher rates of relational victimization (51 %) than reputational victimization (17 %) or physical victimization (14 %). Males reported experiencing more physical victimization than females, but males and females did not differ in rates of relational or reputational victimization. Whereas relational and physical victimization were both uniquely associated with greater anxiety for both males and females, relational victimization was associated with greater depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem for males but not females. These findings indicate that young adolescents with ADHD frequently experience peer victimization and that the association between victimization and internalizing problems among young adolescents with ADHD differs as a result of victimization type, internalizing domain, and sex.

ID GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; CHILDREN; ACCULTURATION
AB Understanding the immigrant paradox on health outcomes among UK's immigrant adolescents will greatly complement the research on immigrants that has already been established there by economists and interdisciplinary fields. This study used the first Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 2004-2010 database (N = 15,770) to determine a) whether there was evidence of the immigrant paradox on internalizing mental health symptoms between first generation (n = 753) and second plus generation (n = 3042) 14/15 year old immigrant adolescents in England and b) whether differences (if any) were moderated by ethnicity group membership (Black African, Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Asian Other, White Immigrant). Findings demonstrate that overall first generation adolescent immigrants had statistically fewer internalizing symptoms as compared to second plus generation, and that this was especially true for Black African adolescents. Effect sizes measures however indicated that these differences were negligible. Implications for protective factors and future studies are briefly discussed.

AB The current study examined relational aggression as a potential mechanism that explains the association between off-time pubertal development and internalizing problems in youth. Youth gender was also examined as a moderator for the association between these variables. It was hypothesized that early pubertal maturation would be associated with higher levels of relationally aggressive behavior which, in turn, would be associated with elevated levels of internalizing problems. Parents of 372 children between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Parents responded to demographic information about themselves, as well as information about their child's pubertal timing, relationally aggressive behavior, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Findings indicated that early pubertal timing was associated with higher levels of anxiety directly, and higher levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms indirectly through higher levels of relational aggression. In all but one of the pathways examined, gender was not found to moderate the associations between the study variables of interest. This study is the first to examine relational aggression as a mechanism by which early pubertal timing leads to internalizing problems. The findings suggest that relational aggression could be a target for intervention among early developing youth who are at risk for internalizing problems.

AB Objective: Problematic Internet Use (PIU), broadly conceptualized as an inability to control one's use of the Internet leading to negative consequences in daily life, is fast becoming a matter of significant concern in our society, particularly in adolescents. In the present study we aimed to assess a model in which metacognitions and emotion regulation independently predicted PIU.
   Method: A total of 380 adolescent students from a secondary school in Italy voluntarily participated in the study. Students completed a set of online self- report scales assessing PIU, metacognitions, and emotion regulation.
   Results: Metacognitions, with the exception of cognitive self-consciousness, were positively correlated with PIU. Moreover, emotion regulation negatively correlated with PIU. The model tested indicated that both metacognitions and emotion regulation had direct effects (positive and negative respectively) on PIU and that the relationship between metacognitions and emotion regulation was not significant.
   Conclusions: Both metacognitions and emotion regulation appear to be relevant to PIU among adolescents. We discuss the implications of these findings.

The effect of these experiences on adolescent mental health is not well understood. In this study, we examine how Internet attachment is related to anxiety and depression and assess the mediating effect of cyber victimization on these associations. Participants included 1,151 middle school students (51.4 percent males) aged 10 to 16 (M=12.7, SD=0.93). Structural equation models show that greater Internet attachment was associated with more cyber victimization and greater symptoms of anxiety and depression. Cyber victimization mediated the associations between Internet attachment and anxiety and between Internet attachment and depression. Implications for online awareness efforts are discussed.

AB Although prior research has consistently documented the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and poor mental health outcomes, the mechanisms that underlie this link are still unclear. The present 3-wave longitudinal study tested the mediating role of anger regulation in the discrimination-mental health link among 269 Mexican-origin adolescents (M-age = 14.1 years, SD = 1.6; 57% girls), 12 to 17 years old. Three competing anger regulation variables were tested as potential mediators: outward anger expression, anger suppression, and anger control. Longitudinal mediation analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling that disaggregated within-person effects from between-person effects. Results indicated that outward anger expression was a significant mediator; anger suppression and anger control were not significant mediators. Within a given individual, greater racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with more frequent outward anger expression. In turn, more frequent outward anger expression was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression at a given time point. Gender, age, and nativity status were not significant moderators of the hypothesized mediation models. By identifying outward anger expression as an explanatory mechanism in the discrimination-distress link among Latino youths, this study points to a malleable target for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating the detrimental impact of racism on Latino youths' mental health during the developmentally critical period of adolescence.

AB The role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.

AB Background: The Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP), (high scores in Anxious/ Depressed, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior subscales), has been related to poor emotional and behavioral self-regulation in children and adolescents. Our aim is to evaluate if it may be associated with auto-aggression in youth with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
   Method In 72 consecutively referred youths with ODD, emotional dysregulation was assessed with the CBCL-DP, auto-aggression and physical aggression against other persons with the Modified Overt Aggression Scale.
   Results: Regression analysis showed that greater higher CBCL-DP scores were associated to higher levels of auto-aggression, even when controlling for the levels of physical aggression against others and CBCL Total score. Limitations: The small sample size, the cross-sectional design, and the lack of a control group limit the generalization of our findings.
   Conclusions: Referred ODD youths with higher scores of CBCL-DP are more likely to present auto aggression, besides aggression against others. The CBCL could improve the screening and detection of these high-risk patients.

AB The latest studies and practice guidelines for the treatment of adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa agree in pointing out the key role played by parents in determining the young patients' therapeutic possibilities and outcomes. Still family functioning has usually been studied using only self-reported instruments. The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the triadic interactions within the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa using a semi-standardized observational tool based on a recorded play session, the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP). Parents and adolescent daughters, consecutively referred to adolescent neuropsychiatric services, participated in the study and underwent the observational procedure (LIP). The 20 families of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (restricting type) were compared with 20 families of patients with internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression). The results showed different interactive patterns in the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa: they had greater difficulties in respecting roles during the play, maintaining the joint attention and in sharing positive affect, especially in the three-together phase (third phase). The majority of these families (12) exhibited collusive alliances. The parental subsystem appeared frequently unable to maintain a structuring role, i.e., providing help, support and guidance to the daughters, while the girls in turn often found it hard to show independent ideas and develop personal projects. Parents experienced difficulty in carving out a couple-specific relational space, from which the ill daughter was at least temporarily excluded also when they were asked to continue to interact with each other, letting the daughter be simply present in a third-part position (fourth phase). The study of the triadic interactions in the families of adolescents with anorexia nervosa may help to shift the attention from the exclusive mother daughter relation to the involvement of the father, and of the parental couple as a whole. The family functioning is in fact well established as a maintaining factor of anorexia nervosa or vice versa as a facilitating factor in the therapeutic process.

AB In this study we examined the relative risk of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) associated with a history of physical and sexual abuse/assault, poor attachment relationships, and poor emotion regulation among adolescents. A total of 2,637 adolescents (aged 12-15 years) completed questionnaires at 3 time-points: baseline, 12, and 24 months later. Across the study, 9.4% reported a history of NSSI. Each of past or recent abuse/assault, poor attachment relationships, and poor emotion regulation was associated with NSSI. We also observed a potential high-risk group among those reporting recent sexual abuse or assault. Knowledge of abuse history, recent sexual assault, attachment, and emotion regulatory ability will enable clinicians to assist adolescents in avoiding some of the more negative outcomes of these, including NSSI.

AB Background: Research has supported the notion that emotion dysregulation is a core feature of BPD. However, given that this feature is typical of healthy adolescents as well as adolescents with other psychiatric disorders, the specificity of emotion dysregulation to BPD in this age group has not yet been determined. The overall aim of this study was to examine emotion dysregulation in adolescent inpatients with BPD compared with non-BPD inpatient adolescents and healthy non-clinical adolescents, taking into account both global emotion dysregulation deficits and more specific impairments.
   Method: The sample included 185 adolescent inpatients with BPD (M = 15.23, SD = 1.52), 367 non-BPD psychiatric inpatient adolescents (M = 15.37, SD = 1.40), and 146 healthy adolescents (M = 15.23, SD = 1.22), all of whom were between the ages of 12 and 17. Borderline personality features were assessed, along with emotion dysregulation and psychiatric severity.
   Results: After controlling for age, gender, and psychiatric severity, results revealed that adolescents with BPD had higher overall emotional dysregulation compared with non-BPD psychiatric controls and healthy controls. These differences were apparent in only two domains of emotion dysregulation including limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective and impulse control difficulties when experiencing negative emotions.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest BPD-specific elevations on emotion dysregulation generally, and subscales related to behavioral regulation specifically.

AB Past research results suggest that executive functioning (EF) impairment represents an important vulnerability factor in depression. Little research, however, has examined mechanisms underlying this association. The current study investigates the associations between EF impairment, emotion regulation (ER) strategies, and depressive symptoms in a sample of 579 adolescents (320 females, mean age =12.06 years). Parents reported on adolescents' EF and general psychopathology, and adolescents self-reported ER strategies and depressive symptoms. The results indicate that greater EF impairment is associated with more depressive symptoms. Youth with greater EF impairment reported more maladaptive ER and less adaptive ER, and maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies jointly mediated the association between EF impairment and depressive symptoms. The results highlight an important role of both maladaptive and adaptive ER in explaining the relationship between EF and depressive symptoms and suggest that clinical interventions targeting ER skills may provide one strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression. Further longitudinal research is needed to replicate these results and evaluate the causality of the relations.

AB Dimensional models of psychopathology that posit a general psychopathology factor (i.e., p factor), in addition to specific internalizing and externalizing factors, have recently gained prominence. However, the stability of these factors and the specificity with which they are related to one another over time (e.g., homotypic or heterotypic continuity) have not been investigated. The current study addressed these questions. We estimated bifactor models, with p, internalizing-specific, and externalizing-specific factors, with youth and caretaker reports of symptoms at two time points (18 months apart), in a large community sample of adolescents. Results showed strong stability over time with highly specific links (i.e., p factor at Time 1 to Time 2; internalizing-specific at Time 1 to Time 2 and externalizing-specific at Time 1 to Time 2), suggesting strong homotypic continuity between higher order latent psychopathology factors.

ID ORIENTATION; SATISFACTION; PSYCHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND
   The current study aimed to examine the multiple mediation of emotion regulation and coping strategies in the relationship between perceived stress and positivity in adolescents.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   Participants included 312 adolescents attending high schools. 162 of the participants were female and 150 were male, with an average age of 16.26, SD = 1.21. Data collection was conducted with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotion Regulation Scale for Adolescents, the Coping Scale for Children and Youth, and the Positivity Scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, regression based on ordinary least squares, and the bootstrap method were used to analyze the research data.
   RESULTS
   The research findings indicated that internal dysfunctional emotion regulation, assistance seeking, problem solving, and behavioral avoidance mediated the relationship between perceived stress and positivity.
   CONCLUSION
   In conclusion, internal dysfunctional emotion regulation, seeking assistance, problem solving, and behavioral avoidance were found to mediate the relationship between adolescents' perceived stress and positivity. Thus, preparing individual and group psychological counseling as well as emotion regulation and coping-oriented psycho-educational programs for adolescents to regulate negative emotions and to cope with stress may be important. The research findings were discussed and interpreted based on the relevant literature, and suggestions for relevant experts were included.

AB The current study aims to examine the strategies of adolescents' emotion regulation to predict the Internet addiction and the smartphone addiction. The study participants included totally 262 high school students with 132 females (50.4%) and 130 (49.6%) males. Students' ages ranged between 14 and 19 with average age being 16.57, SD = 1.13. Emotion Regulation Scale for Adolescents, Young Internet Addiction Test-Brief Form, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Brief Form, and Personal Information Form were used as instruments to collect data in the current research. Based on the research findings, it was seen that external-dysfunctional emotion regulation, internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation, and internal-functional emotion regulation significantly predicted both the Internet addiction and the smartphone addiction; however, external-functional emotion regulation predict neither of the variables on significant levels. Emotion regulation strategies overall explained the 38% of variance in the Internet addiction and 19% of that in the smartphone addiction. The current research findings were discussed and interpreted, and suggestions were included for relevant researchers.

AB Background: There are significant gaps in our understanding of vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in adolescents and whether it is associated with psychosocial difficulties as well as risk factors such as child maltreatment.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in adolescents and young adults.
   Method: 570 participants (ages 14-21) from the community completed an online survey. Vulnerable and grandiose narcissism were assessed with the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, while psycho-social difficulties were assessed with the Child Behaviour Checklist and maltreatment with the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire.
   Results: Gender-specific age trends were identified, with narcissism appearing to decrease with age for females, while increasing for males into early adulthood. For females, vulnerable and grandiose narcissism was associated with maltreatment and partially mediated the relationship between abuse and neglect and internalizing and externalizing difficulties.
   Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of considering the relationship between childhood maltreatment experiences and suggest that the relationship between such experiences and adolescent psychosocial difficulties may be partially accounted for by the negative impact that maltreatment has on narcissism.

AB The present meta-analysis integrates research from 1,015 studies on associations of parenting dimensions and styles with internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. Parental warmth, behavioral control, autonomy granting, and authoritative parenting showed very small to small negative concurrent and longitudinal associations with internalizing symptoms. In contrast, harsh control, psychological control, authoritarian, and, in part, neglectful parenting were associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Parental warmth, behavioral control, harsh control, psychological control, autonomy granting, and authoritative parenting predicted change in internalizing symptoms over time, with associations of internalizing symptoms with parental warmth, psychological control, and authoritative parenting being bidirectional. Moderating effects of study characteristics are identified. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB Despite increasing societal acceptance of sexual-minority individuals, there are still gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) adolescents who experience negative mental health outcomes. Minority stress theory posits that stigma-related stress associated with sexual-minority status drives increased risk among GLB individuals. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that minority stress impacts emotion regulation (ER), identified as a particularly important risk factor for sexual-minority youth (SMY). Current research has identified some aspects of parenting contribute to GLB youth's mental health. We review the literature in these areas, and also integrate research from the broader developmental field on families and emotion socialization in order to identify the need for studies of parenting that go beyond existing data on parental acceptance and supportiveness of youth's sexual orientation. Limitations of the current literature and directions for future research are discussed, with specific focus on implications for interventions with SMY and their families.

   RESPONSES
AB Objective: Engagement in risk behaviors, including substance use, risky sex, and violence, tends to increase throughout adolescence into young adulthood. One motivational process that may underlie risk behaviors during adolescence is negative reinforcement. Moreover, gender and internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) may both convey risk for negative reinforcement-based risk taking. Along these lines, the aims of the current study were to (a) examine gender differences in negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity and (b) examine internalizing symptoms as a moderator of the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity. Method: Participants included 103 youth between the ages of 18 and 21 (50.49% female, age M(SD) = 19.41(1.06)) who were recruited from a large Mid-Atlantic university between September 2013 and November 2014. Participants completed self-report assessments of internalizing symptomatology and a computerized behavioral analog assessment of negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity. Results: Results indicated that, overall, female older adolescents were riskier under conditions of negative reinforcement than male older adolescents. In addition, internalizing symptoms significantly moderated the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity such that the relationship between gender and negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity was nonsignificant at high levels of internalizing symptoms, and female gender was significantly positively predictive of heightened negative reinforcement-based risk-taking propensity at low levels of internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Thus, although female youth overall were riskier, the predictive utility of gender for negative reinforcement-based risk taking may be most relevant at low levels of internalizing symptoms. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future prevention and intervention.

AB The Scale of Impulsivity and Emotion Dysregulation (IES-27) in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) became established in research and in practice for adult patients. An adapted version of the instrument can also be applied to juveniles (IES-27-J) as well as their relatives (IES-27-A). The aim of the study was to evaluate these self-assessment and external assessment scales. The psychometric properties of the IES-27-J were verified by means of two independent psychiatric samples (n = 109 and n = 170), while the IES-27-A was verified with a sample of relatives (n = 31). Item analysis revealed good results for both instruments. The Internal consistency was a =.95 for the IES-27-J in both samples and a =.92 for the IES-27-A. The test retest reliability was excellent (p =.97). Based on a principal component analysis, a one-factor structure was concluded for the IES-27-J. Juveniles with BPD achieved significantly higher sum scores than patients with a depressive or conduct disorder, which can be an indication of the discriminative validity of the IES-27-J. The two questionnaires correlate moderately. Both versions can be applied in research and in practice. In the future, standardization should be achieved using data from healthy adolescents.

AB The purpose of this research is the effect of anger management training on adolescents' emotional regulation. The statistical population is all teenage girls in high school's 2nd grade in Asemanabad town in academic year of 2015-2016. We used random sampling to select 30 of them as research's sample which gathered the highest score from questionnaire. The research tool is Gratz and Roemer's difficulties in emotion regulation scale (DERS).Before interventions, a pre-test had been conducted on both groups. After, training sessions had been conducted for trial group in 8 one hour long periods. Post-test was conducted on both groups after the end of sessions. We used covariance for data analysis. The results confirm the effectiveness of anger management training on difficulty of emotion regulation. Anger is of the most fervent emotions which can impose a lot of damages on mental and physical health.

AB A substantial majority of homeless youth and young adults (HYA) experience abuse prior to and during homelessness. HYA also have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior. This study investigated relationships between traumatic experiences, PTSD symptoms, substance use, and the protective effects of emotion regulation on outcome variables suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Data were drawn from a sample of 398 HYA interviewed at 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles County. A bivariate logistic regression modeling strategy was employed to examine relationships among demographic characteristics and dependent and independent variables. Trauma prior to homelessness and trauma prior to and after homelessness were positively associated with suicidal ideation, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations. PTSD symptoms were positively associated with suicide attempts, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations. Better emotion regulation is associated with reduced odds of suicidal ideation and attempts in HYA and may protect against effects of traumatic experiences. Interventions targeting emotion regulation skills in HYA to reduce suicidality associated with traumatic experiences merit additional investigation.

AB Discrimination experienced by Latino youth in school has been explored in past research although the interrelatedness of culture and educational stressthe stress due to Hispanic culture not being acknowledged in school and racial tensions in schoolhas been less studied. The current study examines the effect of this stress on internalizing symptoms among 58 low-income Latino adolescents (M-age =13.31, 53% male) and tests whether ethnic identity moderates this association. Results show that culture and educational stress is associated with worse mental health. Further, a significant ethnic identity X stress interaction was found for somatic problems showing that youth high in ethnic identity exploration reported more somatic problems in the face of high culture and educational stress. Hence, youth who are more actively exploring their identity may be more vulnerable to the damaging context of culture and educational stress. Implications for multicultural consultation are discussed.

AB Family violence has been associated with various negative outcomes among children and adolescents. Yet, less is known about how unique forms of physical family violence contribute to externalizing and internalizing behaviors based on a child's developmental stage. Using data from the Illinois Families Study and administrative Child Protective Services data, we explored the relation between 3 types of physical family violence victimization and externalizing and internalizing behaviors among a sample of 2,402 children and adolescents. After including parent and family level covariates in Poisson regressions, we found that a unique form of family violence victimization was associated with increased externalizing behaviors among children at each age group: exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among children ages 3-5, exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling among children ages 6-12, and child physical abuse among adolescents ages 13-18. No form of physical family violence was significantly associated with internalizing behaviors for children in any age group. Including exposure to the child maltreatment of a sibling is crucial when attempting to contextualize children's responses to family violence and providing comprehensive services in an effort to enhance the well-being of all children in a family.

AB BACKGROUND
   Parentification means distortion of the roles between family members. A child performs adult tasks and responsibilities for his siblings and/or parents. The aim of the study was to extend the knowledge about parentification and its connections with parental conflict as well as strategies of coping with parental conflict in the group of late adolescents who live with their parents or live on their own.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The empirical evidence consisted of the results of 264 volunteer late adolescents. Two questionnaires were used in the study. The first one was the experimental version of the Polish adaptation of Hooper's Parentification Inventory. It is a scale that enables one to assess the intensity of parentification levels that are judged retrospectively by the subject. The second tool was the experimental version of the Polish adaptation of Davies' and Forman's Security in the Interparental Subsystem Scale - Child Report. The scale examines children's reactions to parental conflict.
   RESULTS
   The obtained results suggest that intensity of parental conflict and strategies of coping with it influence parentification characteristics. The connections seem to be different in two adolescent groups - those who still live with their parents and those who decided to live on their own.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Thus, parental conflict may foster tightening of the family bonds and intensify parentification at the same time. On the other hand, in order to separate and break excessive family ties, adolescents may move out of the family house.

AB Background Emotion regulation difficulties have been associated with depression and anxiety in typically developing individuals. However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists.
   Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted.
   Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences.
   Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.

AB Background: Recovery high schools (RHS) vary in organization and operating philosophy, but are designed to support the unique needs of students struggling with substance use disorders (SUD). Previous research on youth risk taking behaviors suggests emotion regulation is a key predictor of outcomes. Specifically, the ability to respond in adaptive rather than maladaptive ways is often associated with challenges of impulsivity, poor distress tolerance, and adolescent substance use. Objectives: The current study considers data from RHS students in order to answer research questions concerning impulsivity and emotion regulation of youth working to change their risk trajectories in comparison to group of typically developing youth. Methods: Participants (n = 114) in the study were composed of students enrolled in 3 RHS programs and a comparison group of similar aged youth (15-20years) without an identified SUD. Data collection occurred through an anonymous online survey set of four measures of reactivity and impulsivity, emotion regulation, and parent and peer influence, as well as an online version of the Stroop Inhibitory Control Task. Results: Participants in the three RHS groups reported decreased emotion regulation abilities, increased impulsivity and increased peer influence when compared to the comparison group; differential effects within RHS are presented. Conclusions/Importance: Results are consistent with the extant literature that difficulty regulating emotions is associated with an increased risk for substance abuse and suggests these difficulties persist in early recovery. Results also suggest the need to better understand how different operating philosophies of programs influence student outcomes and the recovery process.

AB Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the longitudinal relation between internalizing problem behaviors (measured with the anxious/depressed and somatic complaints subscales of the Achenbach Teacher's Report Form) and self-reported cigarette smoking behavior and intentions during early adolescence. In addition, a possible mediating role of perceived harm was investigated. Methods: Sixth graders and their teachers were surveyed in the sixth grade and students were surveyed again in the seventh grade. Smoking behavior and intentions were assessed with five items including lifetime use, 30-day use, tobacco user status (nonsmoker to heavy smoker), and two intentions/behavioral expectations items. In addition to perceived harm from smoking, reasons for smoking and reasons for not smoking were included on the survey. Results: As hypothesized, teacher reports of sixth-grade internalizing problem behaviors were negatively related to seventh-grade smoking behavior and intentions. Moreover, perceived harm from smoking was negatively related to smoking and intentions. The hypothesized mediating role of perceived harm in the internalizing to smoking relationship was not supported. Conclusions: Potential differences in the relation between internalizing and smoking across adolescence are discussed. Specifically, the results of the present study and an examination of prior literature suggest that in early adolescence internalizing problems are negatively related to cigarette smoking, whereas in middle and late adolescence the opposite is true.

AB The current study examined risk and protective factors across microsystems that impact the development of internalizing symptoms and aggression over 4 years in a sample of culturally diverse, rural adolescents. We explored whether risk and protective factors across microsystems were associated with changes in rates of internalizing symptoms and aggressive behavior. Data came from the Rural Adaptation Project (RAP), a 5-year longitudinal panel study of more than 4,000 students from 26 public middle schools and 12 public high schools. Three level HLM models were estimated to predict internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and aggression. Compared with other students, risk for internalizing symptoms and aggression was elevated for youth exposed to risk factors in the form of school hassles, parent-child conflict, peer rejection, and delinquent friends. Microsystem protective factors in the form of ethnic identity, religious orientation, and school satisfaction decreased risk for aggression, but were not associated with internalizing symptoms, whereas future orientation and parent support decreased risk for internalizing symptoms, but not aggression. Results indicate that risks for internalizing symptoms and aggression are similar, but that unique protective factors are related to these adolescent behavioral health outcomes. Implications and limitations were discussed.

AB Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience poor social-emotional adjustment and interactions with peers, but taking care of a family pet may serve as a buffer. This study utilized 81 parent-adolescent dyads to examine how dimensions of pet ownership (responsibility, comfort, companionship) may be associated with social emotional adjustment (depression, loneliness, friendship quality) among adolescents with ASD, as well as how social impairments may influence these relations. Results revealed that adolescents who took more responsibility for their pet exhibited fewer depressive symptoms. Additionally, parents of more socially impaired adolescents reported better friendship quality than less socially impaired adolescents. Findings suggest taking care of a pet may facilitate better social-emotional adjustment among adolescents with ASD. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Age of onset, callous-unemotional (CU) traits and anger dysregulation have separately been proposed as relevant factors in explaining the heterogeneity of antisocial behaviour (ASB). Taking a dimensional perspective, this study examined the specific contributions and the mutual influences (i.e., interactions) of these three characteristics on specific dimensions of ASB (i.e., criminal behaviours and externalizing symptoms). Assessments were conducted on 536 youths from institutions with the youth psychopathic traits inventory (CU traits), the Massachusetts youth screening instrument-second version (anger dysregulation), the criminology questionnaire (criminal behaviours) and the child behavior checklist (externalizing symptoms), rated by both the youths and their carers. Using Bayes as estimators, the results revealed that the number and frequency of crimes (and, more specifically, damage to property, property offenses and media crimes) were explained by a specific contribution of each factor (age of onset, CU traits and anger dysregulation). Additionally, the interactions between age of onset and CU traits or anger dysregulation were relevant predictors of some types of crimes (i.e., damage to property, property offences and media crimes). Furthermore, when rated by youths, externalizing symptoms were explained by CU traits and anger dysregulation. However, when rated by the carer, anger dysregulation was more important in explaining externalizing symptoms. This study highlights the importance of considering these factors altogether and the value of using a dimensional perspective when examining the structure of ASB in youths. Consequently, future classifications should take into account the mutual account of these characteristics, which were previously studied separately.

AB The current study investigated concurrent and prospective associations between emotion-related constructs and loss of control (LOC) eating in adolescents. Community-based females (N = 588) completed annual self-report assessments of LOC eating, emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and neuroticism from ages 16 to 18 years. Linear regressions and a regression-based multiple mediation model using bootstrapping were computed to examine the relationships among emotion-related constructs and LOC eating frequency. In the concurrent model, age 18 emotional awareness and emotion regulation strategies were associated with age 18 LOC eating, F(6, 416) = 12.11, p < 0.001, accounting for 4.5 % of the variance after controlling for demographics, body mass index, and neuroticism, F change = 10.81, p < 0.001. In the prospective model, age 17 emotional awareness predicted age 18 LOC eating, F(7, 425) = 11.67, p < 0.001, accounting for 1.7 % of unique variance beyond the effects of age 16 LOC eating and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and neuroticism, F change = 4.26, p = 0.015. In the multiple mediation model, age 18 emotion regulation strategies mediated the association between age 17 neuroticism and age 18 LOC eating, indirect effect estimate = 0.003, 95 % confidence interval = 0.001-0.005, after controlling for age 16 LOC eating and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and emotion regulation variables. Results suggest that deficient emotion regulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of LOC eating in adolescence (although effects were small), and may partially explain the well-established prospective relationship between negative emotionality and later LOC eating. Prevention and early intervention programs should seek to improve adaptive coping in at-risk populations.

AB Negative parenting practices are thought to be essential for the development of adolescents' internalizing problems. However, mechanisms linking parental practices to adolescents' internalizing problems remain poorly understood. A potential pathway connecting parental behaviors to internalizing problems could be through adolescent expressive suppression-the tendency to inhibit the observable expression of emotions.This study examined the indirect effects of three individual parenting practices-poor monitoring, inconsistent discipline and use of corporal punishment-on adolescents' internalizing problems through adolescents'regular use of expressive suppression in a sample of 1132 adolescents (10-14 years). Structural Equation Modeling indicated that parenting practices were related both directly and indirectly to adolescents' internalizing problems through their relationship with suppression. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

TI Emotional dysregulation as a predictor of peer attachment perceptions of
   adolescents in residential care
SO PSYCHOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE adolescents; residential care; emotional dysregulation; peer attachment
AB Adolescents who live in residential care tend to have a development characterized by insecure and ambivalent emotional experiences. In addition, they frequently exhibit levels of emotional dysregulation that potentially compromise the quality of their interpersonal relationships. Considering that in this context the peer group has an important role in providing emotional support, the present study aimed to analyse the levels of emotional dysregulation of adolescents living in residential care and to explore its predictive role in the perception of the attachment to peers. The sample is composed of 100 adolescents (71 girls; 29 boys) living in residential care, aged between 12-18 years old. Measures included the Portuguese versions of the Abbreviated Dysregulation Inventory and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (peer version only). The levels of dysregulation were not high, and adolescents displayed a higher affective than a behavioural dysregulation. Only cognitive dysregulation negatively accounted for the variability of communication, trust and perception of attachment to peers in general. This is understandable, since cognition has an important role in managing negative emotions and controlling their behavioural outputs. Albeit modest, the results encourage the promotion of emotional regulation as a means of fostering secure interpersonal relationships in residential care.

AB Higher negative (or lower positive) mood is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among some, but not all youth, suggesting that contextual factors may influence these temperament-symptom relations. Family conflict also is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, although it is unclear whether family conflict influences the relation between negative mood and symptoms. To address this gap, we examined whether family conflict moderates the relations between temperamental negative mood and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Participants were 775 youth (69% male, 76% Caucasian). Mothers and youth completed questionnaires when youth were ages 10-12 (time 1) and 12-14 (time 2). When exposed to higher family conflict at time 1, children higher in negative mood experienced higher time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems than children lower in negative mood. When exposed to lower family conflict, children's internalizing and externalizing symptom levels were similar regardless of their levels of negative mood. Findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing youth's risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms should address conflictual interactions within the larger family system, particularly among youth with higher negative mood.

AB Aim: The complex interplay of externalizing and internalizing problems in substance use risk is not well understood. This study tested whether the relationship of conduct problems and several internalizing disorders with future substance use is redundant, incremental, or interactive in adolescents.
   Methods: Two semiannual waves of data from the Happiness and Health Study were used, which included 3383 adolescents (M age = 14.1 years old; 53% females) in Los Angeles who were beginning high school at baseline. Logistic regression models tested the likelihood of past six-month alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and any substance use at follow-up conditional on baseline conduct problems, symptoms of one of several internalizing disorders (i.e., Social Phobia and Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, Panic, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and their interaction adjusting for baseline use and other covariates.
   Findings: Conduct problems were a robust and consistent risk factor of each substance use outcome at follow-up. When adjusting for the internalizing-conduct comorbidity, depressive symptoms were the only internalizing problem whose risk for alcohol, tobacco, and any substance use was incremental to conduct problems. With the exception of social phobia, antagonistic interactive relationships between each internalizing disorder and conduct problems were found when predicting any substance use; internalizing symptoms was a more robust risk factor for substance use in teens with low (vs. high) conduct problems.
   Conclusions: Although internalizing and externalizing problems both generally increase risk of substance use, a closer look reveals important nuances in these risk pathways, particularly among teens with comorbid externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB Using latent class analyses (LCA), the present study aimed to test whether meaningful subtypes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors could be found among Chinese community-based adolescents. A total of 5244 adolescents, ages 11-18 years (M = 15.11, SD = 1.79) recruited from 16 Chinese middle schools completed the Chinese version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-C). We examined the data using Latent Class Analysis to identify subtypes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors among the adolescents. Multivariate Logistic regression was subsequently implemented to ascertain the relationships between latent classes and demographic covariates. Three distinct subtypes were uncovered: a high-risk group, a middle-risk group and a low-risk group; the three subtypes accounted for 19.8, 31.1, and 49.1 % of the total sample variance respectively. Youth with elevations in one behavior type were likely to have elevations in the other behavior type. Further analyses revealed that compared to the low-risk group, the adolescents from the high-risk group and middle-risk groups were female and older. Significant heterogeneity in internalizing and externalizing behaviors was revealed in this Chinese adolescent's sample. Profiling behavior problems patterns is potentially useful as a first step in developing tailored prevention and intervention programs. Suggestions for future research, including cross-national studies, and implications for mental health professionals were discussed.

AB Growth mixture modeling was used to identify different trajectories of body mass index (BMI) among adolescents ages 10-15 from a national sample. Three distinct classes were found for both boys and girls: "normative" (90.9% and 89.7%), "high increasing" (6.3% and 7.4%), and "decreasing" (2.8% and 2.9%). Multinomial logistic regression identified family income as predictive of class membership for boys and pubertal status and being rural as predictive for girls. Parent-reported health was a common predictor across gender. Growth curves of internalizing symptoms and physical activity were modeled to explore trends across classes. Findings highlight complexities in the relations between BMI, internalizing symptoms, and physical activity in this developmental period.

AB Efforts to regulate emotions can influence others, and interpersonal emotion regulation within teams may affect athletes' own affective and motivational outcomes. We examined adolescent athletes' (N = 451, N teams = 38) self- and interpersonal emotion regulation, as well as associations with peer climate, sport enjoyment, and sport commitment within a multilevel model of emotion regulation in teams. Results of multilevel Bayesian structural equation modeling showed that athletes' self-worsening emotion regulation strategies were negatively associated with enjoyment while other-improving emotion regulation strategies were positively associated enjoyment and commitment. The team-level interpersonal emotion regulation climate and peer motivational climates were also associated with enjoyment and commitment. Team-level factors moderated some of the relationships between athletes' emotion regulation with enjoyment and commitment. These findings extend previous research by examining interpersonal emotion regulation within teams using a multilevel approach, and they demonstrate the importance of person- and team-level factors for athletes' enjoyment and commitment.

AB Impaired empathy is associated with a variety of psychiatric conditions; however, little is known about the differential relations between certain forms of psychopathology and cognitive and affective empathy in adolescent girls and boys. The aim of this study was to examine the relations between externalizing and internalizing disorders and cognitive and affective empathy, respectively, while controlling for covariance among different forms of psychopathology, separately in girls and boys. A total of 507 inpatient adolescents (319 girls and 188 boys) in the age range of 12-17 years completed the Basic Empathy Scale that measures affective and cognitive empathy. The Youth Self-Report Form and Child Behavior Checklist were used to assess the severity of psychopathological symptoms. Results demonstrated that affective and cognitive empathy were negatively associated with conduct problems only in girls, but not in boys. Affective empathy was positively related to internalizing problems observed by parents and youths and self-reported ADHD symptoms in girls and boys. The clinical implications of these differential relationships for externalizing versus internalizing symptoms and empathy are discussed.

AB Background: Using the person-oriented approach, we determined the relationships between four indicators (restraint and eating, shape, and weight concerns) of disordered eating (DE), as measured by the self-reported Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), to identify typical DE patterns. We then related these patterns to clinical EDE-Q cut-off scores and emotion dysregulation, depression, self-esteem, and two categories of DE behaviors (>= 2 or <= 1 "yes" responses on the SCOFF questionnaire).
   Method: Typical patterns of DE were identified in a community sample of 1,265 Swedish adolescents (M-age = 16.19, SD = 1.21; age range 13.5-19 years) using a cluster analysis. Separate analyses were performed for girls (n = 689) and boys (n = 576).
   Results: The cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution for each gender. Four of the six clusters for girls and five for boys showed scores above the clinical cut-off on at least one of the four DE indicators. For girls, the two clusters that scored above the clinical cut-offs on all four DE indicators reported severe psychological problems, including high scores on emotion dysregulation and depression and low scores on self-esteem. In contrast, for boys, although two clusters reported above the clinical cut-off on all four indicators, only the cluster with exceedingly high scores on shape and weight concerns reported high emotion dysregulation and depression, and extremely low self-esteem. Furthermore, significantly more girls and boys in the most problematic DE clusters reported = 2 "yes" responses on the SCOFF questionnaire (as opposed to = 1 response), indicating clear signs of DE and severe psychological difficulties.
   Conclusion: We suspect that the various problematic DE patterns will require different paths back to a healthy diet. However, more research is needed to determine the developmental trajectories of these DE patterns and ensure more precise clinical cut-off scores, especially for boys. Comprehensive understanding of DE patterns might be of use to healthcare professionals for detecting DE before it develops into an eating disorder.

AB We contribute to the literature on the relations of temperament to externalizing and internalizing problems by considering parental emotional expressivity and child gender as moderators of such relations and examining prediction of pure and co-occurring problem behaviors during early to middle adolescence using bifactor models (which provide unique and continuous factors for pure and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems). Parents and teachers reported on children's (4.5- to 8-year-olds; N = 214) and early adolescents' (6 years later; N = 168) effortful control, impulsivity, anger, sadness, and problem behaviors. Parental emotional expressivity was measured observationally and with parents' self-reports. Early-adolescents' pure externalizing and co-occurring problems shared childhood and/or early-adolescent risk factors of low effortful control, high impulsivity, and high anger. Lower childhood and early-adolescent impulsivity and higher early-adolescent sadness predicted early-adolescents' pure internalizing. Childhood positive parental emotional expressivity more consistently related to early-adolescents' lower pure externalizing compared to co-occurring problems and pure internalizing. Lower effortful control predicted changes in externalizing (pure and co-occurring) over 6 years, but only when parental positive expressivity was low. Higher impulsivity predicted co-occurring problems only for boys. Findings highlight the probable complex developmental pathways to adolescent pure and co-occurring externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB Research to date on child and adolescent anxiety and depression have focused predominantly on major ethnic groups. Very few studies to date have been conducted on specific ethnic minority groups and the relatively few studies on these ethnic minority samples have produced mixed findings. The following question therefore still remains: Do specific ethnic subgroups differ with respect to their expression of anxiety and depression? And do these differences differ as a function of reporter type (i.e., youth versus parent)? If the expression of internalizing symptoms differs across specific ethnic subgroups, these differences could inform approaches to assessing and treating these populations. In the current study, we therefore examined ethnic differences in anxiety and depression symptoms in ethnic subgroups. A total of 629 children and adolescents from various public and private schools, aged 8-18 years (M = 12.37, SD = 2.8) and their caregivers completed anxiety and depression scales. Multiple indicators, multiple causes confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the following specific ethic subgroups were associated with significantly greater anxiety and depression relative to Caucasian youth: Chinese American, Filipino American, Japanese American, and Native Hawaiian. These results were found only among parent (but not youth) reports. Age and low SES status was also associated with more internalizing problems among Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese American youth. Implications related to ethnic minority subgroup differences and the role of multi-informant reports in understanding the relationship between anxiety, depression and ethnic minority subgroups are discussed.

AB It is well known, based on previous research, that adolescents' thoughts and feelings about their future are related to the risk of delinquency, alcohol use as well as health. However, other well-known facts are that adolescents' actions are substantially shaped in interaction with peers and that, during adolescence, individuals spend a considerable amount of the day at school, in interaction with classmates. Despite this, there is an almost complete lack of studies exploring to what extent the school climate, as measured by thoughts and feelings about the future, can influence individual adolescents. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the future orientation (FO) climate, measured at the school class level, is related to delinquency, alcohol use and internalizing problems at the individual level, among a sample of Swedish students 14-15 years of age. The data used come from the Swedish part of the Youth in Europe (YES!) study, which is part of the larger project Children of Immigrants - Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU). In the present paper, we use data from the first wave, collected among 8th grade students in 2010/11 (n = 4119-4364). The method used was multilevel modeling (linear probability models (LPM) and linear regression analysis). The results showed that, in school classes where a high proportion of students'had a positive future orientation, the risk of heavy alcohol use at the individual level was lower, also after adjusting for individual FO and for individual- and class-level socioeconomic conditions. A similar, but not statistically significant, tendency was found for delinquency. In addition, having a high proportion of students with a positive FO in a school class was associated with fewer internalizing problems, also after controlling for individual FO and socioeconomic conditions at the individual and school class level. We conclude that the surrounding school class, in terms of its general future orientation climate, may play a role for individual outcomes in the form of problem behaviors and mental health.

AB Investigating protective and risk factors that influence mental health in young people is a high priority. While previous cross-sectional studies have reported associations between diet and mental health among adolescents, few prospective studies exist. The aim of this study was to examine prospective relationships between dietary patterns and mental health among adolescents participating in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess indicators of mental health (Youth Self-Report externalizing/internalizing T-scores) and Western and Healthy dietary patterns (identified using factor analysis) at 14 (2003-2005) and 17 years (2006-2008). Multivariate linear and logistic regression were used to assess relationships between dietary patterns and mental health. Complete data were available for 746 adolescents. In females only, the Western dietary pattern z-score at 14 years was positively associated with greater externalizing behaviors at 17 years (beta = 1.91; 95% CI: 0.04, 3.78) and a greater odds of having clinically concerning externalizing behaviors at 17 years (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.41). No other statistically significant associations were observed. Overall our findings only lend partial support to a link between diet and mental health. We found it to be specific to females consuming a Western dietary pattern and to externalizing behaviors. Future research on dietary patterns and mental health needs to consider possible sex differences and distinguish between different mental health outcomes as well as between healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns.

AB Prior research links poor maternal emotion regulation to maladaptive parenting and child behaviors, but little research is available on these relationships during the adolescent period. We use structural equation modeling to assess the influence of poor maternal emotion regulation, measured as emotional reactivity and distancing, on adolescent behaviors (measured as aggression and prosocial behaviors) among 478 adolescents (53 % female; baseline age 10-13 years) and their mothers over a 5 year period. We also tested the possible mediating roles of family functioning and parenting behaviors between maternal emotion regulation and adolescent behaviors. Results indicated that higher baseline maternal emotional distancing and reactivity were not directly predictive of adolescents' behaviors, but they were indirectly related through family functioning and parenting. Specifically, indulgent parenting mediated the relationship between maternal emotional reactivity and adolescent aggression. Maternal-reported family functioning significantly mediated the relationship between maternal emotional distancing and adolescent aggression. Family functioning also mediated the relationship between emotional distancing and regulation parenting. The results imply that poor maternal emotion regulation during their child's early adolescence leads to more maladaptive parenting and problematic behaviors during the later adolescent period. However, healthy family processes may ameliorate the negative impact of low maternal emotion regulation on parenting and adolescent behavioral outcomes. The implications for future research and interventions to improve parenting and adolescent outcomes are discussed.

AB Emotion regulation and associated autonomic activation develop throughout childhood and adolescence under the influence of the family environment. Specifically, physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity such as interoceptive sensitivity and vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) can inform on emotion regulation. Although the effect of parental emotion socialization on emotion regulation appears to be influenced by autonomic processes, research on physiological regulation and the influence of parental factors remains scarce. This study investigated the relationship between self-reported habitual emotion regulation strategies and HRV at rest as well as interoceptive sensitivity in forty-six youngsters (27 female; age: M = 13.00, SD = 2.13). Secondly, the association between these autonomic correlates and parental psychopathology was also studied. Whereas better interoceptive sensitivity was related to reduced maladaptive emotion regulation, specifically rumination, high HRV was related to more use of external emotion regulation strategies (i.e., support seeking). In addition, increased HRV and decreased interoceptive sensitivity were associated with maternal internalizing and there was evidence for a possible mediation effect of HRV in the relationship between maternal internalizing and child external emotion regulation. This study elucidates the link between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and underlying physiological regulation in adolescents but also indicates a putative influence of maternal internalizing symptoms on emotion regulation in their offspring.

AB Adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents with childhood sexual abuse related post-traumatic stress disorder (CSA-related PTSD) show a large overlap in symptomatology. In addition, brain research indicated hyper-responsiveness and sustained activation instead of habituation of amygdala activation to emotional faces in both groups. Little is known, however, about whether the same patterns of amygdala habituation are present in these two groups. The current study examined habituation patterns of amygdala activity to emotional faces (fearful, happy and neutral) in adolescents with a DSM-IV depressive and/or anxiety disorder (N = 25), adolescents with CSA-related PTSD (N = 19) and healthy controls (N = 26). Behaviourally, the adolescents from the internalizing and CSA-related PTSD group reported more anxiety to fearful and neutral faces than adolescents from the control group and adolescents from the CSA-related PTSD group reacted slower compared to the internalizing group. At the whole brain level, there was a significant interaction between time and group within the left amygdala. Follow-up ROI analysis showed elevated initial activity in the amygdala and rapid habituation in the CSA-related PTSD group compared to the internalizing group. These findings suggest that habituation patterns of amygdala activation provide additional information on problems with emotional face processing. Furthermore, the results suggest there are differences in the underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to emotional face processing for adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents with CSA-related PTSD. Possibly CSA-related PTSD is characterized by a stronger primary emotional response driven by the amygdala. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB BackgroundTeen dating violence (TDV) is a common phenomenon of great public concern. TDV may lead to severe long-term consequences for victims and offenders, and even more so for females than for males.
   AimThe aim of this paper is to investigate possible underlying factors for involvement in TDV either as a perpetrator or a victim. Social learning theory is commonly used to explain internalisation of parents' behaviour on children's behavioural expressions, but less so on parents' emotion regulation as a direct link to later TDV.
   MethodWe used longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study (N=2450) to investigate if and how parents' positive and negative emotion regulation is related to TDV, controlling for early aggression and race.
   ResultsResults show a moderately strong association between parents' negative emotion regulation and their daughters' involvement in serious dating violence. We also found that many more African American girls were involved in TDV compared to Caucasian girls, both as a perpetrator and victim.
   Conclusions and practical implicationsWe discuss directions for future research focusing on emotion regulation and dating violence. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB ObjectiveaEuro integral Sleep problems are frequent in children and robustly predict internalizing symptoms in adolescence and adulthood. Longitudinal investigations have nonetheless used broad measures of childhood sleep problems, precluding understanding of the specific sleep problems that presage affective disturbances. Similarly, prospective examinations of mechanistic variables linking early sleep with subsequent internalizing symptoms are lacking.aEuro integral MethodaEuro integral Childhood bedtime and nighttime waking problems were examined as independent predictors of adolescent internalizing symptoms within a community sample from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,089). The mediational role of emotional reactivity in late childhood also was examined.aEuro integral ResultsaEuro integral Bedtime but not nighttime waking problems significantly predicted adolescent internalizing problems. This relationship was partially explained by child emotional reactivity.aEuro integral ConclusionsaEuro integral Some childhood sleep problems may more reliably predict later internalizing symptoms than others. Temperamentally based emotional reactivity may potentiate affective risk associated with childhood sleep difficulties.

AB The current investigation examined if interparental conflict (IPC), including psychological and physical violence, moderated the relationship between parental depressive symptoms and youth internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively, in a sample of youth with a parent with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One hundred and eighty families with a parent with a history of MDD (M (age) = 41.96; 88.9 % mothers) and a youth in the target age range of 9-to-15 years (49.4 % females; M (age) = 11.46) participated. Findings indicated that IPC exacerbated the effect of parental depressive symptoms on internalizing, but not externalizing, problems for both males and females. Findings suggest that, in families with a parent who has a history of depression, parental depressive symptoms and IPC together have important implications for youth internalizing problems. Targeting improvement for both parent depressive symptoms and interparental conflict may directly lead to decreases in youth internalizing symptoms in the context of parental depression.

AB The current study investigates the effect of adolescent harm avoidance (HA) on maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies (mCER) in early adulthood. The mediating role of inhibitory control and the moderating effect of gender on this link were also examined. Longitudinal data from 261 adolescents (147 female) were collected in three phases (T0, T1 and T2) over approximately 10 years. Results revealed that, after controlling for HA in adulthood (T2), female adolescents' HA (TO) significantly predicted mCER strategies after 10 years (T2), whereas male adolescents' HA only predicted catastrophizing. In addition, attentional impulsivity (T1) significantly mediated the relation between HA and mCER, though only among women. There was no significant indirect effect for emotional interference and stop-signal reaction time. Results revealed gender and measure specific associations between HA and inhibitory control and suggest that HA could induce inhibitory deficits leading to mCER.

AB The aim of this study was to test whether the association between attachment and internalizing symptoms was mediated by regulatory emotional self-efficacy. A total of 763 Chinese young adolescents (48% male; aged 11-17 years, M = 12.79 years, SD = 0.75) completed measures of paternal, maternal, and peer attachment and regulatory emotional self-efficacy, while each adolescent's parent completed a measure of adolescent internalizing symptoms. Mediating effect was tested by using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the relations of paternal, maternal, or peer attachment with internalizing symptoms were fully mediated by regulatory emotional self-efficacy. Furthermore, the indirect effect of the perceived capability to regulate negative affect was stronger than that of the perceived capability to express positive affect. These findings suggest that regulatory emotional self-efficacy could be one mechanism explaining how young adolescents' parental or peer attachment influences their internalizing symptoms.

AB Objective: To examine the associations among self-reported loss-of-control (LOC) eating, emotion dysregulation, body mass, and objective energy intake among youth. Emotion dysregulation may be 1 individual factor that promotes excess energy intake and increases in body mass among youth with LOC eating. Method: Children and adolescents (N = 230; 8 to 17 years) enrolled in a nonintervention study completed a structured interview to determine the presence or absence of self-reported LOC eating. Children's emotion dysregulation was assessed via parent-report with the Child Behavior Checklist. Youth also completed 2 test meals to capture "binge" and "normal" eating. Body composition was examined using air displacement plethysmography. Results: After controlling for relevant covariates, youth with self-reported LOC eating had higher parent-reported emotion dysregulation than those without LOC. Parent-reported emotion dysregulation was also associated with greater observed energy intake (after accounting for body mass), as well as higher fat mass. Emotion dysregulation also moderated associations between LOC status/gender and body mass variables; among youth with self-reported LOC eating and girls, those with high parent-described emotion dysregulation (vs. low) had significantly higher fat mass and BMIz. Conclusions: Data from the current study suggest that emotion dysregulation may play a role in energy intake and obesity, particularly among youth with self-reported LOC eating and girls. Additional studies are needed to identify the prospective mechanisms linking poor emotion regulation and LOC eating. These mechanisms, in turn, may inform future interventions targeting excess energy intake and obesity in pediatric samples.

AB Background: Emotional dysregulation and impaired attachment are potential contributors to the development of psychopathology in adolescence. This raises the question of whether oxytocin (OT), the paradigmatic "attachment hormone," may be beneficial in such contexts. Recent evidence suggests that intranasal administration of OT increases affiliative behavior, including trust and empathy. OT may also facilitate social reciprocity by attenuating the stress response to interpersonal conflict. To date, few studies have investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on neurophysiological emotion regulation strategies in healthy adolescents, particularly during parent-adolescent interaction. To understand these mechanisms, our study will examine the effects of IN-OT on emotion regulation in adolescents during parent-adolescent stressful interactions, and on each adolescent's visual and neurophysiological strategies when visualizing attachment-related pictures. We hypothesize that IN-OT will influence psychophysiological outcomes under conditions of stress. We predict that IN-OT will momentarily increase feelings of safety and attenuate stress and hostile behavior during conflict situations. OT may also enhance attachment security by increasing comfort and proximity-seeking, and reducing neurophysiological hyperactivation.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of IN-OT on insecure adolescents by studying their behavior and discourse during a disagreement with one of their parents. Their neurophysiological responses to pictures eliciting attachment-related emotions and their visual exploration strategies will also be investigated.
   Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group design, 60 healthy male adolescents classified as insecurely attached will receive 24 international units (IU) of IN-OT versus placebo (PB), 45 minutes before the experimental tasks. Each adolescent will then be invited to engage in an experimental conflict discussion with one of his parents. The conflict session will be videotaped and coded for verbal and non-verbal interaction behavior, using the Goal-Corrected Partnership in Adolescence Coding System (GPACS). Each adolescent will then be asked to visualize attachment-related pictures on a screen. Eye-tracking (ET) and neurophysiological responses, including electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR), will be recorded simultaneously and continuously during attachment-related picture viewing (Besancon Affective Picture Set-Adolescents, BAPS-Ado).
   Results: Enrollment for the study was completed in May 2016. Data analysis commenced in July 2016. Study results will be submitted for publication in the winter of 2017.
   Conclusions: OT is a complex molecule with many facets that are not yet fully understood. This experimental protocol will increase scientific and clinical knowledge of emotion regulation skills in insecure adolescents by assessing the impact of IN-OT on parent-adolescent interaction and on the visual processing of attachment-related emotions. Positive results could lead to therapeutic uses of IN-OT to treat emotion dysregulation in adolescence.

Results indicate that attachment security is inversely related to risk-taking in sexual relationships. Less risk-taking is associated with attachment to mother and peers in sexually inactive adolescents while in the sexually active with the capacity for emotional regulation. Differences were found in gender and attachment styles and among sexually active and inactive adolescents.

AB The purpose of this research is to examine the mediating role of automatic thoughts and cognitive emotion regulations strategies on the relationship among childhood maltreatment experiences, behavioral problems and resilience of adolescents. The sample of the study has consisted of 671 adolescents (338-girl, 322-boy). Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form, Youth Self Report, Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale, Resiliency Scale and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire have been used. Research findings have shown that adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and automatic thoughts have entire mediator role in relation between adolescents' childhood abuse/neglect experience and resilience. However maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and automatic thoughts have partial mediating role in the relation between adolescents' childhood abuse/neglect experience and behavioral problems. On the other hand maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies have no mediating effect on relationship between adolescents' childhood abuse/neglect experience and resilience levels and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies have no mediating effect on relationship between adolescents' childhood abuse/neglect experience and behavioral problems. In explaining the variance of behavioral problems, it has been found that the most effective variables are respectively the automatic thoughts, childhood abuse / neglect experiences and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies; adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and automatic thoughts are respectively the most important variables to explain variance of resilience.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop an Anger Regulation Scale for Adolescents (ARS-A), and investigate its validity, and reliability for Turkish adolescents.
   Method: The participants were 630 secondary school students from 6th to 8th grade. Data were collected from four different sample groups attending the school. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis for ARS-A were employed to examine validity of the scale. In order to check the criterion-related validity of ARS-A, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used. Convergent and differential reliability of the scale was examined, and parallel analysis was performed to determine number of factors of the scale. To test the reliability of the scale, Composite reliability, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, item-total correlation values and test-retest values were computed.
   Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three factor solution explaining 50.17% of variance. Moreover, confirmatory factor analysis performed with 18 items of ARS-A supported the three-factor solution and the model had good fit values. Cronbach's alpha values indicating internal dysfunctional anger regulation subdimensions, were determined as 0.77 and as 0.78 for functional anger regulation and 0.76 for external-dysfunctional anger regulation subdimensions. The scale was applied to 97 students with two weeks' interval, and test-retest reliability values were determined as r=0.74 for internal dysfunctional anger regulation, r=0.62 for both external dysfunctional anger regulation and functional anger regulation subdimensions.
   Conclusion: The present study indicates that the Anger Regulation Scale for Adolescents (ARS-A) is a valid and reliable instrument to asses anger regulation strategies in Turkish adolescents.

AB Associations between urban adolescents' victimization experiences and biological stress responses were examined, as well as emotion regulation as a moderator of these associations. Data from a 4-wave longitudinal study with a low-income, community-based sample (n = 242; 91 % African American; 57 % female; M = 11.98, SD = 1.56 years at baseline) revealed that victimization, assessed over 3 study waves, was associated with an attenuated cortisol response to a stress interview at the final study wave, indicating that responses of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis were dysregulated. Cortisol responses were moderated by caregiver-reported adolescent emotion regulation, suggesting that this modifiable protective factor that is taught in many school-based prevention programs could help reduce harm associated with HPA axis dysregulation linked to victimization.

AB Objective: Sexual activity often begins in early adolescence, and adolescents with mental health symptoms are at greater risk for sexual activity and other health risks. This study aimed to evaluate a developmentally targeted intervention designed to enhance early adolescents' emotion regulation competencies as a strategy for reducing health risk behaviors, including sexual initiation. Method: Adolescents 12 to 14 years old (N = 420; 53% male) with mental health symptoms participated in either an emotion regulation (ER) or health promotion (HP) intervention consisting of 12 after-school sessions. Participants completed questionnaires on laptop computers at baseline, 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Time to event analyses were used to compare intervention conditions on rate of initiation to vaginal sex. Results showed that participants in the ER condition were less likely to transition into vaginal sexual activity by 1-year follow-up than were those in the HP condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [0.36, 0.94], p = .01). However, those who were sexually active did not report differences in sexual risk behaviors (e.g., condomless sex). Participants in the ER condition were significantly less likely to report violence behaviors and showed improvement on a behavioral measure of emotion identification; however, they did not differ from HP participants on self-reports of emotional competence. Conclusions: Emotion regulation strategies can be used to delay sexual initiation among early adolescents with mental health symptoms and may have an important role in health education.

AB Efforts to define hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis profiles conferring risk for psychopathology have yielded inconclusive results, perhaps in part due to limited assessment of the stress response. In particular, research has typically focused on HPA responses to performance tasks, while neglecting the interpersonal stressors that become salient during adolescence. In this study we investigated links between psychosocial adjustment - youth internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as competence - and HPA responses to both performance and interpersonal stressors in a normative sample of children and adolescents. Participants (n=59) completed a set of performance (public speaking, mental arithmetic, mirror tracing) and/or interpersonal (peer rejection) tasks and gave nine saliva samples, which were assayed for cortisol. Hierarchical linear models of cortisol response trajectories in relation to child behavior checklist (CBCL) scores revealed stressor- and sex-specific associations. Whereas internalizing problems related to earlier peaking, less dynamic cortisol responses to interpersonal stress (across males and females), externalizing problems related to lower, earlier peaking and less dynamic cortisol responses to performance stress for males only, and competence-related to later peaking cortisol responses to interpersonal stress for females only. Implications for understanding contextual stress profiles underlying different forms of psychopathology are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the direct effects of psychological problems and emotional dysregulation and the mediating effect of self-esteem on problematic Internet use (PIU) among adolescents in South Korea. This study was conducted as a secondary analysis with the data from "The 2013 Validation Study of K-Scale as a Diagnostic Tool" by the Korean National Information Society Agency (N = 351). Our structural equation modeling analyses revealed that psychological problems and emotional dysregulation affected PIU by mediating low self-esteem; however, the direct effects of psychological problems and emotional dysregulation were not demonstrated. Thus, this study empirically verified that the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU provides a theoretical framework to describe the pathway to PIU among Korean adolescents. The results suggest that preventing and intervening for PIU should include effective strategies that improve self-esteem for adolescents. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Anticipatory cortisol is associated with risk for substance use in adolescents. The present study extended prior literature by testing a model linking family emotional climate, emotion dysregulation, anticipatory cortisol, and substance use. Participants were 229 adolescents (M = 11.94 years, SD = 1.55; 41% male; 92% African American) enrolled in a 4-wave study of stressors, physiological stress responses, and substance use. Caregivers completed measures of family emotional climate at baseline and adolescents' emotion dysregulation one and two years later; adolescents reported on their substance use at baseline and three years later at Wave 4. Adolescents completed a stress task at Wave 4; saliva samples taken immediately prior to the task were analyzed for cortisol. Longitudinal path models revealed that a negative emotional climate at home was associated with elevated emotion dysregulation at subsequent waves for all youth. Emotional dysregulation was prospectively associated with blunted anticipatory cortisol, which in turn was associated with elevated substance use, controlling for baseline substance use and age. However, these associations only were observed for females. This study suggests that helping girls in particular manage their emotional responses to stress more effectively may impact their physiological responses and reduce risk for substance use.

AB A large and coherent body of evidence reveals that individuals higher in dispositional mindfulness fare better than their less mindful counterparts on a range of psychosocial outcomes. However, few studies have examined the effects of dispositional mindfulness on adolescent mental health, and potential mechanisms underlying its salutary effects. The aim of the present research was to examine whether low dispositional mindfulness was associated with heightened depression, anxiety, stress, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms in a sample of adolescents (N = 113, M-age = 14.9 years), and whether two emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, mediated any association. Results revealed that low mindfulness was associated with poor functioning across all indices of psychopathology. Further, expressive suppression, a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, mediated associations between low mindfulness and depression, anxiety, and stress. In brief, dispositional mindfulness appears to be a protective individual difference characteristic during adolescence, and capacity for emotion regulation may be implicated in its effects on specific symptoms of psychopathology.

AB Emotion dysregulation often emerges early in development and is a core feature of many psychological conditions. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a well validated and widely used self-report measure for assessing emotion regulation problems among adolescents and adults. The DERS has six subscales with five to eight items each (36 total), suggesting multiple questions may assess similar underlying constructs. In an effort to reduce respondent burden and streamline this widely-used instrument, we created a short-form version of the DERS (DERS-SF) using confirmatory factor analysis on data from three adolescent (n = 257) and two adult samples (n = 797). Scores on the DERS-SF yielded similar correlation patterns relative to the full measure, ranging from .90 to .98 and reflecting 81-96 % shared variance. This instrument maintains the excellent psychometric properties and retains the total and subscale scores of the original measure with half the items.

AB This study examined the effects of racial discrimination, community violence, and stressful life events on internalizing problems among African American youth from high-poverty neighborhoods (N = 607; 293 boys; M-age = 16.0 years, SD = 1.44 years). Mediated effects via externalizing problems on these relations were also examined, given the high comorbidity rate between internalizing and externalizing problems. Externalizing problems partially mediated the effect of stressful life events on internalizing problems and fully mediated the effect of racial discrimination for boys but not for girls. Exposure to violence had a significant indirect effect on internalizing problems via externalizing problems. The findings call for greater attention to internalizing problems among African American youth and pathways to internalizing problems via externalizing problems.

AB Adolescence marks the emergence of sex differences in internalizing symptoms and disorders, with girls at increased risk for depression and anxiety during the pubertal transition. However, the mechanisms through which puberty confers risk for internalizing psychopathology for girls, but not boys, remain unclear. We examined two pubertal indicators (pubertal status and timing) as predictors of the development of emotion regulation styles (rumination and emotional clarity) and depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in a three-wave study of 314 adolescents. Path analyses indicated that early pubertal timing, but not pubertal status, predicted increased rumination, but not decreased emotional clarity, in adolescent girls, but not boys. Additionally, rumination mediated the association between early pubertal timing and increased depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms and disorder onset among adolescent girls. These findings suggest that the sex difference in depression may result partly from early maturing girls' greater tendency to develop ruminative styles than boys.

The current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research on these relationships. Included in the meta-analyses are 239 effect sizes from 55 reports, representing responses from 257,678 adolescents. The results of a series of random effects meta-analyses using robust variance estimation indicated positive and significant relationships between peer cybervictimization and a series of internalizing and externalizing problems, with point estimates of this relationship ranging from Pearson's r =.14 to .34. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Background
   Depression during adolescence is a serious mental health problem. Difficulties in regulating evoked emotions after stressful life events are considered to lead to depression. This study examined if depressive symptoms were mediated by various cognitive emotion regulation strategies after stressful life events, more specifically, the loss of a loved one, health threats or relational challenges.
   Methods
   We used a sample of 398 adolescents (M-age = 16.94, SD = 2.90), including 52 depressed outpatients, who all reported stressful life event(s). Path analyses in Mplus were used to test mediation, for the whole sample as well as separately for participants scoring high versus low on depression, using multigroup analyses.
   Results
   Health threats and relational challenging stressful life events were associated with depressive symptoms, while loss was not. More frequent use of maladaptive strategies was related to more depressive symptoms. More frequent use of adaptive strategies was related to less depressive symptoms. Specific life events were associated with specific emotion regulation strategies. The relationship between challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms in the whole group was mediated by maladaptive strategies (self-blame, catastrophizing and rumination). No mediation effect was found for adaptive strategies.
   Conclusion
   The association between relational challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms was mediated by maladaptive, cognitive emotion regulation strategies.

AB The process model of emotion regulation posits that the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal is associated with positive outcomes (e.g., greater positive emotion) while the tendency to use expressive suppression is associated with adverse outcomes (e.g., greater negative emotion). Many studies using adult samples support this theory. However, the development of the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal/expressive suppression and how these tendencies relate to depressive symptoms in adolescents remain unclear. To address these questions, 639 Chinese adolescents aged 12-18 years old were asked to report their tendency to use cognitive reappraisal/expressive suppression as well as their depressive symptoms. General linear model multivariate analysis of variance showed a statistically significant age effect for the tendency to use emotion regulation strategies. Further analysis found that these adolescents reported using less expressive suppression as age increased, while there was no age effect for the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal in daily life negatively influenced depressive symptoms, while the tendency to use expressive suppression in daily life positively influenced depressive symptoms. These findings provide evidence that support the development of emotion regulation strategies in childhood and adolescence.

AB Youth living with HIV (YLH) are at elevated risk of internalizing symptoms, although there is substantial individual variability in adjustment. We examined perceived HIV-related stigma, shame-proneness, and avoidant coping as risk factors of internalizing symptoms among YLH. Participants (N = 88; ages 12-24) completed self-report measures of these potential risk factors and three domains of internalizing symptoms (depressive, anxiety, and PTSD) during a regularly scheduled HIV clinic visit. Hierarchical regressions were conducted for each internalizing symptoms domain, examining the effects of age, gender, and maternal education (step 1), HIV-related stigma (step 2), shame-and guilt-proneness (step 3), and avoidant coping (step 4). HIV-related stigma, shame-proneness, and avoidant coping were each correlated with greater depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Specificity was observed in that shame-proneness, but not guilt-proneness, was associated with greater internalizing symptoms. In multivariable analyses, HIV-related stigma and shame-proneness were each related to greater depressive and PTSD symptoms. Controlling for the effects of HIV-related stigma and shame-proneness, avoidant coping was associated with PTSD symptoms. The current findings highlight the potential importance of HIV-related stigma, shame, and avoidant coping on the adjustment of YLH, as interventions addressing these risk factors could lead to decreased internalizing symptoms among YLH.

AB Objective: To examine differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies in adolescents with and without loss of control over eating (LOC).
   Method: A community-based sample of 524 adolescents from 12 to 18 years old (70.6% girls; M-age = 15.08; SD = 1.59) reported on LOC and the use of several maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies.
   Results: Adolescents who experience LOC (28%) report more use of maladaptive strategies. With regard to adaptive strategies a significant group X gender interaction effect was found with girls who report LOC using less adaptive strategies. More specifically, based on the FEEL-KJ less problem-oriented action, distraction, humor enhancement, acceptance and cognitive problem solving were observed in girls who report LOC compared to those who do not report LOC. Boys with LOC report more use of adaptive strategies compared to those who do not report LOC.
   Discussion: LOC in adolescents is associated with increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies as well as a decreased use of adaptive strategies although the latter is only specific for girls. These results may inform prevention and treatment of emotion regulation problems in adolescents with LOC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
